    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>"A billion husbands are about to be replaced."</b><br /><br />From the author of <i>Fight Club</i>, the classic portrait of the damaged contemporary male psyche, now comes this novel about the apocalyptic marketing possibilities of a new product that gives new meaning to the term "self-help." <br /><br />Penny Harrigan is a low-level associate in a big Manhattan law firm with an apartment in Queens and no love life at all. So it comes as a great shock when she finds herself invited to dinner by one C. Linus Maxwell, a software mega-billionaire and lover of the most gorgeous and accomplished women on earth. After dining at Manhattan's most exclusive restaurant, he whisks Penny off to a hotel suite in Paris, where he proceeds, notebook in hand, to bring her to previously undreamed-of heights of gratification for days on end. What's not to like? <br /><br />This: Penny discovers that she is a test subject for the final development of a line of feminine products to be marketed in a nationwide chain of boutiques called Beautiful You. So potent and effective are these devices that women by the millions line up outside the stores on opening day and then lock themselves in their room with them and stop coming out. Except for batteries. Maxwell's plan for battery-powered world domination must be stopped. But how?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the author of the underground sensation <i>Fight Club</i> comes this wickedly incisive second novel, a mesmerizing, unnerving, and hilarious vision of cult and post-cult life.<br /><br />Tender Branson—last surviving member of the so-called Creedish Death Cult—is dictating his life story into the flight recorder of Flight 2039, cruising on autopilot at 39,000 feet somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He is all alone in the airplane, which will crash shortly into the vast Australian outback. Before it does, he will unfold the tale of his journey from an obedient Creedish child and humble domestic servant to an ultra-buffed, steroid- and collagen-packed media messiah, author of a best-selling autobiography, <i>Saved from Salvation</i>, and the even better selling <i>Book of Very Common Prayer</i> (The Prayer to Delay Orgasm, The Prayer to Prevent Hair Loss, The Prayer to Silence Car Alarms). He'll reveal the truth of his tortured romance with the elusive and prescient Fertility Hollis, share his insight that "the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage," and deny responsibility for the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill, a 20,000-acre repository for the nation's outdated pornography. Among other matters both bizarre and trenchant.<br /><br />Not since Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Mother Night</i> and Jerzy Kosinski's <i>Being There</i> has there been as dark and telling a satire on the wages of fame and the bedrock lunacy of the modern world. Unpredictable, compelling, and unforgettable, <i>Survivor</i> is Chuck Palahniuk at his deadpan peak; and it cements his place as one of the most original writers in fiction today.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Stories you'll never forget—just try—from literature's favorite transgressive author <br /><br />Representing work that spans several years, Make Something Up is a compilation of 21 stories and one novella (some previously published, some not) that will disturb and delight. The absurdity of both life and death are on full display; in "Zombies," the best and brightest of a high school prep school become tragically addicted to the latest drug craze: electric shocks from cardiac defibrillators. In "Knock, Knock," a son hopes to tell one last off-color joke to a father in his final moments, while in "Tunnel of Love," a massage therapist runs the curious practice of providing 'relief' to dying clients. And in "Expedition," fans will be thrilled to find to see a side of Tyler Durden never seen before in a precursor story to Fight Club.<br /><br />Funny, caustic, bizarre, poignant; these stories represent everything readers have come to love and expect from Chuck Palahniuk. They have all the impact of a sharp blow to the solar plexus, with considerable collateral damage to the funny bone.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the master of literary mayhem and provocation, a full-frontal Triple X novel that goes where no American work of fiction has gone before</b><br /><br />Cassie Wright, porn priestess, intends to cap her legendary career by breaking the world record for serial fornication. On camera. With six hundred men. <i>Snuff</i> unfolds from the perspectives of Mr. 72, Mr. 137, and Mr. 600, who await their turn on camera in a very crowded green room. This wild, lethally funny, and thoroughly researched novel brings the huge yet underacknowledged presence of pornography in contemporary life into the realm of literary fiction at last. Who else but Chuck Palahniuk would dare do such a thing? Who else could do it so well, so unflinchingly, and with such an incendiary (you might say) climax?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The hyperactive love child of <i>Page Six</i> and <i>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</i> caught in a tawdry love triangle with <i>The Fan</i>. Even Kitty Kelly will blush. </b><br /><br />Soaked, nay, marinated in the world of vintage Hollywood, <i>Tell-All</i> is a <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>–inflected homage to Old Hollywood when <b>Bette Davis</b> and <b>Joan Crawford</b> ruled the roost; a veritable Tourette’s syndrome of rat-tat-tat  name-dropping, from the A-list to the Z-list; and a merciless  send-up of <b>Lillian Hellman</b>’s habit of butchering the truth that will have <b>Mary McCarthy</b> cheering from the beyond. <br /><br />Our <b>Thelma Ritter</b>–ish narrator is <b>Hazie Coogan</b>, who for decades has tended to the outsized needs of <b>Katherine “Miss Kathie”  Kenton</b>—veteran of multiple marriages, career comebacks, and cosmetic surgeries. But danger arrives with gentleman caller <b>Webster Carlton Westward III</b>, who worms his way into Miss Kathie’s heart (and boudoir). Hazie discovers that this bounder has already written a celebrity tell-all memoir foretelling Miss Kathie’s death in a forthcoming <b>Lillian Hellman</b>–penned musical extravaganza; as the body count mounts, Hazie must execute a plan to save <b>Katherine Kenton</b> for her fans—and for posterity. <br /><br /><i>Tell-All</i> is funny, subversive, and fascinatingly clever. It’s wild, it’s wicked, it’s  <b>boldfaced</b>—it’s vintage <b>Chuck</b>.]]></book_description>
