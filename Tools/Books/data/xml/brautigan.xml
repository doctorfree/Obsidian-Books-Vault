    <book_description><![CDATA[In all of the obituaries and writing about Richard Brautigan that appeared after his suicide, none revealed to Ianthe Brautigan the father she knew. Through it took all of her courage, she delved into her memories, good and bad, to retrieve him, and began to write. <i>You Can't Catch Death </i>is a frank, courageous, heartbreaking reflection on both a remarkable man and the child he left behind.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Literary Nonfiction. Memoir. In DOWNSTREAM FROM TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA: A MEMOIR OF RICHARD BRAUTIGAN, Keith Abbott paints a portrait of Richard Brautigan as a lovable and whimsical friend. Abbott explains the writer's dedication to the art of fiction and his quest to break beyond the pop culture, hippie label that haunted him until his suicide in1984. Brautigan's tight prose inspired authors such as Haruki Murakami, and his experimentation with the line won him accolades from authors like Ishmael Reed, Raymond Carver, and Michael McClure. His work is highly influential and Abbott draws a clear connection between Brautigan's life and his writing. This book is essential for anyone who is interested in the work of Richard Brautigan. As Raymond Carver wrote, "Truly the best thing I've ever seen written of the man."]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[By far the best book on Brautigan I have read. Most reviewers just never "got" Brautigan and the subsequent works on his life and writing reflected those misconceptions, misunderstandings, and plain mistruths. Keith Abbott not only paints a loving portrait of the author, poet, and friend but provides us with what is perhaps the best literary analysis and review of Brautigan's writing.<br /><br />I whole heartedly recommend this book not only for the Brautigan fanatic but I think it would make a great introduction to the reader just embarking on a study of Brautigan.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Brautigan's excellent novel is definately worth the quick read, then worth another to catch all his language play. Having grown up near Big Sur, this book was particularly funny as Lee Mellon is still in residence there. <br /><br />Brautigan's descriptions of drugs, drinks, frogs &amp; the commas of Ecclesiastes are all done in a straightforward style. A favorite paragraph: <br />"He broke the seal on the bottle, unscrewed the cap &amp; poured a big slug of whiskey into his mouth. He swallowed it down with a hairy gulp. Strange, for as I said before: he was bald." A great read. <br /><br />If there's one thing the world lacks, it's a good supply of well-written, funny-as-heck books. Luckily, aside from A Confederacy Of Dunces, we have this little gem. The characters are drunks, druggies, skanks, prostitutes &amp; nutzoids. The pace is brisk, the imagry vivid. Most of it seemed to be part of my own life, but just where do you find weed that's so potent that 4 people smoking 5 joints stay high for well over 2 hours?<br /><br />If you want to spend a day or night having a good laugh over a great book, pick this one up. You'll laugh out loud. As Martha Stewart says, "it's a good thing".]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[On the eve of his departure from Eugene, Oregon, to San Francisco and worldly success, a twenty-one-year-old unpublished writer named Richard Brautigan gave these funny, buoyant stories and poems as a gift to Edna Webster, the beloved mother of both his best friend and his first "real" girlfriend. "When I am rich and famous, Edna," he told her, "this will be your social security.' The stories and poems show Brautigan as hopelessly lovestruck, cheerily goofy, and at his most disarmingly innocent. We see not only a young man and young artist about to bloom, but also the whole literary sensibility of the 1960s counterculture about to spread its wings and fly.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Rommel Drives on Deep into Egypt by Richard Brautigan. a collection of eighty-five poems, was Brautigan's sixth collection of poetry; his eighth poetry book publication. <br /><br />Brautigan visited Roxy and Judy Gordon in Austin, Texas, in August 1970. While there he was issued a Texas fishing license (August 14, 1970). It notes his height (6'4") and weight (165 pounds). <br /><br />The poem "Autobiography (Polish It like a Piece of Silver)," collected in <b>Loading Mercury with a Pitchfork</b>, contains a reference to Judy Gordon and Byrds, a town in central Texas, near Brownwood. Two poems, "A Study in Roads" and "Stone (real," both collected in June 30th, June 30th contain references to Bee Caves, Texas, a small town twelve miles west of Austin. Brautigan may have visited Bee Caves with the Gordons. Roxy Gordon, in turn, dedicated his book, Some Things I Did (Austin, Texas: The Encino Press, 1971) to<br /><br />RICHARD BRAUTIGAN<br />whose favorite gun is<br />the Colt Navy .36<br /><br />In publicity materials associated with the publication of Gordon's book Brautigan wrote:<br />Roxy and Judy Gordon are two very nice people with an open and perceptive way. Reading Roxy's book is to meet them.<br /><br />As to Gordon's reference to Brautigan's interest in the Colt Navy .36 handgun, novelist Tom McGuane said<br />[Brautigan] had a fascination with the . . . Colt because it seemed to sum up gun owning, democratic gun manufacture, and excellence, all in one thing.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Richard Brautigan's last novel, published in the U.S. for the first time<br /><br />Richard Brautigan was an original--brilliant and wickedly funny, his books resonated with the sixties, making him an overnight counterculture hero. Taken in its entirety, his body of work reveals an artistry that outreaches the literary fads that so quickly swept him up.<br /><br />Dark, funny, and exquisitely haunting, his final book-length fiction explores the fragile, mysterious shadowland surrounding death. Told with classic Brautigan wit, poetic style, and mordant irony, <i>An Unfortunate Woman</i> assumes the form of a peripatetic journal chronicling the protagonist's travels and oblique ruminations on the suicide of one woman, and a close friend's death from cancer.<br /><br />After Richard Brautigan committed suicide, his only child, Ianthe Brautigan, found among his possessions the manuscript of <i>An Unfortunate Woman</i>. It had been completed over a year earlier, but was still unpublished at the time of his death. Finding it was too painful to face her father's presence page after page, she put the manuscript aside.<br /><br />Years later, having completed a memoir about her father's life and death, Ianthe Brautigan reread An Unfortunate Woman, and finally, clear-eyed, she saw that it was her father's work at its best and had to be published.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>This is an alternate cover edition for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4670201" rel="nofollow noopener">9789643623876</a> </i><br /><br />داستان، روایت یک کارآگاه خصوصی‌ست که در خواب و خیال شهر قدیمی و افسانه‌ای بابل، تمام زندگی‌اش را باخته است. راوی البته جایی به طور ضمنی به باختن اعتراف نمی‌کند ولی یخچال خالی و مملو از کپک و آپارتمان بی پنجره و گرسنگی و خیلی تصاویر عینی دیگری که سرتاسر داستان را در تلخ و شیرین طنزش غرق کرده، نشان از این بیچارگی و بازنده بودن دارد. این رمان از معدود آثار «براتیگان» است که روایتی سر‌راست دارد. <br />در رؤيای بابل از موفق‌ترين و ماندگارترين آثار ريچارد براتيگان، نويسنده‌ی نوآور آمريکايي، است. رمانی درنهايت جذابيت، که حاصل تجربيات اعجاب‌انگيز نويسنده در عرصه‌ی خلاقيت ادبی است. اين اثری همتا و حتی فراتر از صيدقزل‌آلادرآمريکا است که سنت‌شکنی ادبی را در آميزه‌ای از ژانرهای سنتی (داستان کارآگاهی و رمان علمی ـ تخيلی) به نمايش می‌گذارد: براتيگان در بهترين براتيگان‌بازی‌اش.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Brautigan's poetic style is often surreal, often tender, with touches of humor. The poems are written in clear, straightforward free verse. Here is an example of his style from "The Chinese Checker Players": "When I was six years old/I played Chinese checkers/with a woman/who was ninety-three years old."<br /><br />Recurrent themes in the book include love, sex, loss &amp; loneliness. Incorporated throughout are an intriguing mix of pop &amp; 'high' culture references: Jefferson Airplane, Ophelia, the New York Yankees, John Donne etc. The book often has an earthy flavor. He writes about such topics as his own penis or the smell of a fart. Some particularly memorable poems include the following:<br /><br />"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace," a sci-fi vision of a "cybernetic meadow"; the open-ended "Karma Repair Kit: Items 1-4"; "Discovery," a joyful poem about sexual intimacy; the surreal "The Pumpkin Tide"; the funny, haiku-like "November 3"; &amp; "A Good-Talking Candle," which invites readers into altered states of perception. <br /><br /> Altho most of the poems are very short, there is one longer poem: the 9-part, 9-page "the Galilee Hitch-hiker," which chronicles the surreal adventures of Baudelaire — among other experiences, he opens an unconventional hamburger stand in San Francisco. If you only know Brautigan from his weird &amp; wonderful novels, read this collection.-Michael Mazza (edited)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Three unforgettable Brautigan masterpieces reissued in a one-volume omnibus edition. <br /><br />REVENGE OF THE LAWN: Originally published in 1971, these bizarre flashes of insight and humor cover everything from "A High Building in Singapore" to the "Perfect California Day." This is Brautigan's only collection of stories and includes "The Lost Chapters of TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA."<br /><br />THE ABORTION: AN HISTORICAL ROMANCE 1966: A public library in California where none of the books have ever been published is full of romantic possibilities. But when the librarian and his girlfriend must travel to Tijuana, they have a series of strange encounters in Brautigan's 1971 novel.<br /><br />SO THE WIND WON'T BLOW IT ALL AWAY: It is 1979, and a man is recalling the events of his twelfth summer, when he bought bullets for his gun instead of a hamburger. Written just before his death, and published in 1982, this novel foreshadowed Brautigan's suicide.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A reclusive young man works in a San Francisco library for unpublishable books. Life's losers, an astonishing number of whom seem to be writers, can bring their manuscripts to the library, where they will be welcomed, registered and shelved. They will not be read, but they will be cherished. In comes Vida, with her manuscript. Her book is about her gorgeous body, in which she feels uncomfortable. The librarian makes her feel comfortable, and together they live in the back of the library until the trip to Tijuana changes them in ways neither of them had ever expected.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>Richard Brautigan was a literary idol of the 1960s and 1970s whose comic genius and iconoclastic vision of American life caught the imagination of young people everywhere. He came of age during the Haight-Ashbury period and has been called the last of the Beats.” His early books became required reading for the hip generation, and on its publication Trout Fishing in America became an international bestseller. An indescribable romp, the novel is best summed up in one word: mayonnaise.<br /> </p><p>This new edition includes an introduction by the poet Billy Collins, who first encountered Brautigan’s work as a student in California.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An omnibus edition of three counterculture classics by Richard Brautigan that embody the spirit of the 1960s.<br /> <i>Trout Fishing in America</i> is by turns a hilarious, playful, and melancholy novel that wanders from San Francisco through America's rural waterways; <i>In Watermelon Sugar</i> expresses the mood of a new generation, revealing death as a place where people travel the length of their dreams, rejecting violence and hate; and <i>The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster</i> is a collection of nearly 100 poems, first published in 1968.]]></book_description>
