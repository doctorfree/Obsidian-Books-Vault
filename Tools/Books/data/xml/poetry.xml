    <book_description><![CDATA[Rommel Drives on Deep into Egypt by Richard Brautigan. a collection of eighty-five poems, was Brautigan's sixth collection of poetry; his eighth poetry book publication. <br /><br />Brautigan visited Roxy and Judy Gordon in Austin, Texas, in August 1970. While there he was issued a Texas fishing license (August 14, 1970). It notes his height (6'4") and weight (165 pounds). <br /><br />The poem "Autobiography (Polish It like a Piece of Silver)," collected in <b>Loading Mercury with a Pitchfork</b>, contains a reference to Judy Gordon and Byrds, a town in central Texas, near Brownwood. Two poems, "A Study in Roads" and "Stone (real," both collected in June 30th, June 30th contain references to Bee Caves, Texas, a small town twelve miles west of Austin. Brautigan may have visited Bee Caves with the Gordons. Roxy Gordon, in turn, dedicated his book, Some Things I Did (Austin, Texas: The Encino Press, 1971) to<br /><br />RICHARD BRAUTIGAN<br />whose favorite gun is<br />the Colt Navy .36<br /><br />In publicity materials associated with the publication of Gordon's book Brautigan wrote:<br />Roxy and Judy Gordon are two very nice people with an open and perceptive way. Reading Roxy's book is to meet them.<br /><br />As to Gordon's reference to Brautigan's interest in the Colt Navy .36 handgun, novelist Tom McGuane said<br />[Brautigan] had a fascination with the . . . Colt because it seemed to sum up gun owning, democratic gun manufacture, and excellence, all in one thing.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Brautigan's poetic style is often surreal, often tender, with touches of humor. The poems are written in clear, straightforward free verse. Here is an example of his style from "The Chinese Checker Players": "When I was six years old/I played Chinese checkers/with a woman/who was ninety-three years old."<br /><br />Recurrent themes in the book include love, sex, loss &amp; loneliness. Incorporated throughout are an intriguing mix of pop &amp; 'high' culture references: Jefferson Airplane, Ophelia, the New York Yankees, John Donne etc. The book often has an earthy flavor. He writes about such topics as his own penis or the smell of a fart. Some particularly memorable poems include the following:<br /><br />"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace," a sci-fi vision of a "cybernetic meadow"; the open-ended "Karma Repair Kit: Items 1-4"; "Discovery," a joyful poem about sexual intimacy; the surreal "The Pumpkin Tide"; the funny, haiku-like "November 3"; &amp; "A Good-Talking Candle," which invites readers into altered states of perception. <br /><br /> Altho most of the poems are very short, there is one longer poem: the 9-part, 9-page "the Galilee Hitch-hiker," which chronicles the surreal adventures of Baudelaire — among other experiences, he opens an unconventional hamburger stand in San Francisco. If you only know Brautigan from his weird &amp; wonderful novels, read this collection.-Michael Mazza (edited)]]></book_description>
