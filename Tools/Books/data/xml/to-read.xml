    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Justine knows she's going to die. Any second now.</i><br /> <br />Justine Jones has a secret. A hardcore hypochondriac, she’s convinced a blood vessel is about to burst in her brain. Then, out of the blue, a startlingly handsome man named Packard peers into Justine’s soul and invites her to join his private crime-fighting team. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime deal. With a little of Packard’s hands-on training, Justine can weaponize her neurosis, turning it outward on Midcity’s worst criminals, and finally get the freedom from fear she’s always craved. End of problem.<br /><br />Or is it? In Midcity, a dashing police chief is fighting a unique breed of outlaw with more than human powers. And while Justine’s first missions, including one against a nymphomaniac husband-killer, are thrilling successes, there is more to Packard than meets the eye. Soon, while battling her attraction to two very different men, Justine is plunging deeper into a world of wizardry, eroticism, and cosmic secrets. With Packard’s help, Justine has freed herself from her madness—only to discover a reality more frightening than anyone’s worst fears.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.”</i><br /><br />So begins <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>, an expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem. As our story opens, a mysterious plague has fallen upon the quiet English village of Meryton—and the dead are returning to life! Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace, but she’s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy. What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers—and even more violent sparring on the blood-soaked battlefield. Can Elizabeth vanquish the spawn of Satan? And overcome the social prejudices of the class-conscious landed gentry? Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses,]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Cover by Mitchell Hooks.<br />Big Sur is a 1962 novel that recounts the time when Kerouac (here known by the name of his fictional alter-ego Jack Duluoz), at the height of his fame, stayed for a period of time--a few days, actually--at a cabin in Big Sur, owned by Kerouac's friend and Beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, struggling to get over what might be a nervous breakdown, alcoholism or both. For a while the writer lives a happy, contemplative life of simple pleasures, until his craving for company drives him back to the city. The book is very dark, and deals very directly and explicitly with delirium tremens.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Nobody quite knew what to make of them. Bets swung both ways, but as the self-styled revolutionaries swelled in number and the media culture exulted, zealots turned violent and the press immediately warned of dogfights in the sky, street battles, mind games and soul wars. Behind the scenes, the Powers That Be were strangely silent.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the 50 years that have passed since Alfred Latka's death in 1949 his position as the father of mathematical demography has been secure. With his first demographic papers in 1907 and 1911 (the latter co- authored with F. R. Sharpe) he laid the foundations for stable population theory, and over the next decades both largely completed it and found convenient mathematical approximations that gave it practical applica- tions. Since his time, the field has moved in several directions he did not foresee, but in the main it is still his. Despite Latka's stature, however, the reader still needs to hunt through the old journals to locate his principal works. As yet no exten- sive collections of his papers are in print, and for his part he never as- sembled his contributions into a single volume in English. He did so in French, in the two part Theorie Analytique des Associations Biologiques (1934, 1939). Drawing on his Elements of Physical Biology (1925) and most of his mathematical papers, Latka offered French readers insights into his biological thought and a concise and mathematically accessible summary of what he called recent contributions in demographic analy- sis. We would be accurate in also calling it Latka's contributions in demographic analysis.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[When Captain Carlsen entered the vast derelict spaceship, he was stunned by its awesome splendor--and shaken by the discovery of its immobilized humanoid passengers.<br /><br />Later, after three of those strange aliens had been transported to Earth, his foreboding was more than justified. The creatures were energy vampires whose seductive embraces were total, whose lust for vitality was boundless. As they took over the willing bodies of their victims and sexual murders spread terror throughout the land, Carlsen worked toward their destruction--even though he was erotically drawn to the most beautiful vampire of all!]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Stimulating and often startling discussions between three friends, all highly original thinkers: Rupert Sheldrake, controversial biologist, Terence McKenna , psychedelic visionary, and Ralph Abraham , chaos mathematician. Their passion is to break out of paradigms that retard our evolution and to explore new possibilities. Through challenge and synergy they venture where few have gone before, leading their readers on an exciting journey of discovery. Their discussions focus on the evolution of the mind, the role of psychedelics, skepticism, the psychic powers of animals, the structure of time, the life of the heavens, the nature of God, and transformations of consciousness.<br /><br />“Three fine thinkers take us plunging into the universe of chaos, mind, and spirit. Instead of leaving us lost, they bring us back with startling insights and more wonder than we knew we had.” —Matthew Fox, <i>Original Blessing and Sheer Joy</i><br /><br />"A jam-session of the mind, an intellectual movable feast, an on-going conversation that began over twenty years ago and remains as lively and relevant today as it ever was. Sadly, Terence had to leave the conversation a little earlier than planned. But the appearance of this book of trialogues at this critical, historical juncture is a reaffirmation of the potency of the optimistic vision that the trialogues express." —Dennis McKenna, brother of the late Terence McKenna<br /><br />Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author of many books including <i>The Sense of Being Stared At, And Other Aspects of the Extended Mind</i>. Ralph Abraham is a mathematician, one of the pioneers of chaos theory and the author of several books including <i>Chaos, Gaia, Eros: A Chaos Pioneer Uncovers the Three Great Streams of History.</i> The late Terence McKenna was a scholar of shamanism, ethno-botanist, psychedelic researcher and author of many books including <i>Food of the Gods and True Hallucinations</i>.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Three of the most original thinkers of our time explore issues that call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life. <br /><br />• A wide-ranging investigation of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos theory in the dynamics of human creation, and the rediscovery of traditional wisdom. <br /><br />In this book of "trialogues," the late psychedelic visionary and shamanologist Terence McKenna, acclaimed biologist and originator of the morphogenetic fields theory Rupert Sheldrake, and mathematician and chaos theory scientist Ralph Abraham explore the relationships between chaos and creativity and their connection to cosmic consciousness. Their observations call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life in the universe. The authors challenge the reader to the deepest levels of thought with wide-ranging investigations of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos in the dynamics of human creation, and the resacralization of the world. Among the provocative questions the authors raise are: Is Armageddon a self-fulfilling prophecy? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined? Are the eternal laws of nature still evolving? What is the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness? <br /><br />Part ceremony, part old-fashioned intellectual discussion, these trialogues are an invitation to a new understanding of what Jean Houston calls "the dreamscapes of our everyday waking life."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Few books have caused as big a stir as John Steinbeck’s <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, when it was published in April 1939. By May, it was the nation’s number one bestseller, but in Kern County, California—the Joads’ newfound home—the book was burned publicly and banned from library shelves. <i>Obscene in the Extreme</i> tells the remarkable story behind this fit of censorship.When W. B. “Bill” Camp, a giant cotton and potato grower, presided over its burning in downtown Bakersfield, he declared: “We are angry, not because we were attacked but because we were attacked by a book obscene in the extreme sense of the word.” But Gretchen Knief, the Kern County librarian, bravely fought back. “If that book is banned today, what book will be banned tomorrow?”<br /><br /><i>Obscene in the Extreme</i> serves as a window into an extraordinary time of upheaval in America—a time when, as Steinbeck put it, there seemed to be “a revolution . . . going on.”]]></book_description>
