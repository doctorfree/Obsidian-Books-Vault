On the windswept world of Bleak, a string of murders lead a writer to a story with unbelievable ramifications. One man survives the vicious attacks, but is left with a morbid fascination with death; the perfect candidate for the perilous job of working on a rig.<br /><br />Welcome to the System. Here the concept of a god has been abandoned, and a new faith pervades: AfterLife, a social media platform that allows subscribers a chance at resurrection, based on the votes of other users.<br /><br />So many Lives, forever interlinked, and one structure at the centre of it all: <i>The Rig</i>.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Neal Stephenson's dazzling novel <i>Snow Crash</i> set the science fiction world on fire, charting out the literary landscape of the next millennium with wild abandon. Now this acclaimed talent has again created a singular vision of the future. Imagine Charles Dickens writing in the 21st century...and you begin to imagine life in <i>The Diamond Age</i>.<br /><br />THE DIAMOND AGE<br /><br />Decades into our future, a stone's throw from the ancient city of Shanghai, a brilliant nanotechnologist named John Percival Hackworth has just broken the rigorous moral code of his tribe, the powerful neo-Victorians. He's made an illicit copy of a state-of-the-art interactive device called <i>A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</i>. Commissioned by an eccentric duke for his grandchild, stolen for Hackworth's own daughter, the <i>Primer</i>'s purpose is to educate and raise a girl capable of thinking for herself. It performs its function superbly. Unfortunately for Hackworth, his smuggled copy has fallen into the wrong hands.<br /><br />Young Nell and her brother Harv are thetes--members of the poor, tribeless class. Neglected by their mother, Harv looks after Nell. When he and his gang waylay a certain neo-Victorian--John Percival Hackworth--in the seamy streets of their neighborhood, Harv brings Nell something special: the <i>Primer</i>. And from the moment she opens the book, her life is changed. She enters a fairy tale in which she is the heroine, challenged with traversing an enchanted world in search of the fabled twelve keys. If successful, she could emerge with untold wisdom and power.<br /><br />Following the discovery of his crime, Hackworth begins an odyssey of his own. Expelled from the neo-Victorian paradise, squeezed by agents of Protocol Enforcement on one side and a Mandarin underworld crime lord on the other, he searches for an elusive figure known as the Alchemist. His quest and Nell's will ultimately lead them to another seeker whose fate is bound up with the <i>Primer</i>--a woman who holds the key to a vast, subversive information network that is destined to decode and reprogram the future of humanity.<br /><br />Vividly imagined, stunningly prophetic, and epic in scope, <i>The Diamond Age</i> is a major novel from one of the most visionary writers of our time.]]></book_description>

Better than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883.Snow_Crash" title="Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson" rel="nofollow noopener">Snow Crash</a>? Maybe.

The stories from the illustrated primer are great. Nell is an absolutely absorbing character in a coming of age tale. Molecular nanotechnology is omnipresent in the novel's world, with Stephenson extrapolating nanotechnology use and implementation in a variety of astounding ways including the integration of nanotechnology with artificial intelligence. The book deals with issues of social class, ethnicity, the effect of stories and education on the development of human personality, and the nature of artificial intelligence.

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the way the world ends. Again.<br /><br />Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.<br /><br />Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.<br /><br /><br /><i>original cover of ISBN <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=0316229296" title="0316229296" rel="nofollow noopener">0316229296</a>/<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=9780316229296" title="9780316229296" rel="nofollow noopener">9780316229296</a></i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Hemingway Hoax is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning novella that weaves an intricate plot of a fake Hemingway manuscript with time travel, multiple universes, and the potential destruction of the omniverse itself. *** Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, lost a bag containing the manuscript of his first novel on a Parisian train. In 1996, John Baird, a renowned Hemingway scholar, decides to use that loss to account for a fake manuscript he creates. *** Little does Baird suspect that his attempt to pass off the forgery as a recovered Hemingway manuscript will take him on a journey involving parallel universes and time travel. For Hemingway's reputation is intricately linked to the fate of multiple worlds in the omniverse and any attempt to change that can have disastrous consequences.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A race for survival among the stars... Humanity's last survivors escaped earth's ruins to find a new home. But when they find it, can their desperation overcome its dangers?<br /><br />WHO WILL INHERIT THIS NEW EARTH?<br /><br />The last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age—a world terraformed and prepared for human life.<br /><br />But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare.<br /><br />Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Ancillary Mercy</i> is the stunning conclusion to the trilogy that began with <i>Ancillary Justice</i>, the only novel ever to win the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke Awards.<br /><br />For a moment, things seemed to be under control for Breq, the soldier who used to be a warship. Then a search of Athoek Station's slums turns up someone who shouldn't exist and a messenger from the mysterious Presger empire arrives, as does Breq's old enemy, the divided, heavily armed, and possibly insane Anaander Mianaai—ruler of an empire at war with itself.<br /><br />Breq could flee with her ship and crew, but that would leave the people of Athoek in terrible danger. Breq has a desperate plan. The odds aren't good, but that's never stopped her before.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Seeking atonement for past crimes, Breq takes on a mission as captain of a troublesome new crew of Radchai soldiers, in the sequel to Ann Leckie's NYT bestselling, award-winning Ancillary Justice. A must read for fans of Ursula K. Le Guin and James S. A. Corey.</b><br /><br />Breq is a soldier who used to be a warship. Once a weapon of conquest controlling thousands of minds, now she has only a single body and serves the emperor.<br /><br />With a new ship and a troublesome crew, Breq is ordered to go to the only place in the galaxy she would agree to go: to Athoek Station to protect the family of a lieutenant she once knew - a lieutenant she murdered in cold blood.<br /><br />Ann Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy has become one of the new classics of science fiction. Beautifully written and forward thinking, it does what good science fiction does best, taking readers to bold new worlds with plenty explosions along the way.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Born in '80, Dr Jim Parsons undergoes abrupt involuntary time travel from 2012 to 2405 to find his profession treated disdainfully. Population is static, with no natural births. Only death allows an embryo's formation. The society's ambivalent about death. Eugenics ensures successive generations better benefit the species. By killing the weak, poverty &amp; disease are eliminated &amp; survival is optimized. A single race derived from African- &amp; Native Americans controls this world. Caucasians were wiped out or integrated centuries earlier.<br /> Parsons cures a woman, not knowing this is a crime. Chancellor Al Stenog exiles him to Mars. The spaceship is intercepted &amp; Parsons is returned to a deserted far future Earth. On finding a marker with instructions on operating the spaceship's time travel controls, he's directed to an Amerind tribal lodge, where he must perform surgery to save the life of a wounded time traveller, Corith, after the latter had died from an arrow wound. Parsons extracts it. It later mysteriously rematerializes in Corith's body.<br /> To resolve the situation, Parsons &amp; Corith's relatives travel back to Corith's previous assignment in 1579 on N. America's west coast, where Corith was to kill Francis Drake to alter history &amp; preserve Amerind lifeways against European subjugation. Observing the assassination attempt, Parsons realizes Drake is actually Stenog, lying in wait for Corith. Parsons tries warning Corith. Corith discovers Parsons is white &amp; attacks him. Struggling, Parsons inadvertently stabs Corith's heart with an arrow meant for Drake.<br /> In retribution, Parsons is left stranded by Corith's relatives in 1597, by which time the Europeans had departed. Parsons is rescued by Loris, Corith's daughter, when she learns she'll have Parson's child in the future. Briefly back in 2405, Parsons realizes the reason the arrow mysteriously reappeared in Corith's chest was because he'd murdered him for a 2nd time to cover his tracks. If Corith recovered, he'd have revealed it was Parsons who killed him &amp; an unwitting Parsons from slightly earlier would've been helpless at the hands Corith's relatives. As he stands over Corith, ready to kill him a 2nd time, he decides against it &amp; tries fleeing. Before doing so, two people appear in the room from the future &amp; kill Corith with the 2nd arrow. Parsons realizes the murderers are children he'd had with Loris, traveling back to 2405 from a more distant future.<br /> His children take Parsons forward in time to meet with Loris again. He struggles with the decision to return to 2012. Eventually he returns to the same day he'd left &amp; to the doting wife who saw him off that morning. He sets about his old life, a new task at hand. The novel ends with him placing the stone marker that'll save his life on a desolate future Earth.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[With The Three-Body Problem, English-speaking readers got their first chance to experience the multiple-award-winning and bestselling Three-Body Trilogy by China's most beloved science fiction author, Cixin Liu. Three-Body was released to great acclaim including coverage in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. It was also named a finalist for the Nebula Award, making it the first translated novel to be nominated for a major SF award since Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities in 1976.<br /><br />Now this epic trilogy concludes with Death's End. Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.<br /><br />Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early 21st century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die in its cradle?<br /><br />Ein halbes Jahrhundert nach der Entscheidungsschlacht hält der Waffenstillstand mit den Trisolariern immer noch stand. Die Hochtechnologie der Außerirdischen hat der Erde zu neuem Wohlstand verholfen, auch die Trisolarier haben dazugelernt, und eine friedliche Koexistenz scheint möglich. Der Frieden hat die Menschheit allerdings unvorsichtig werden lassen. Als mit Cheng Xin eine Raumfahrtingenieurin des 21. Jahrhunderts aus dem Kälteschlaf erwacht, bringt sie das Wissen um ein längst vergangenes Geheimprogramm in die neue Zeit. Wird die junge Frau den Frieden mit Trisolaris ins Wanken bringen – oder wird die Menschheit die letzte Chance ergreifen, sich weiterzuentwickeln?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the second novel in "Remembrance of Earth’s Past", the near-future trilogy written by China's multiple-award-winning science fiction author, Cixin Liu. <br /><br />In <i>The Dark Forest</i>, Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion — four centuries in the future. The aliens' human collaborators have been defeated but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's defense plans are exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret. <br /><br />This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he's the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris wants dead.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Rudy Rucker has seen the future. . .and it is extreme.The Godfather of cyberpunk--a mad scientist bravely meddling in the outrageous and heretical--Rucker created Bopper Robots, who rebelled against human society in his award-winning classic "Software.<br /><br />Now, in 2053, "moldies" are the latest robotic advancement--evolved artificial lifeforms made of soft plastic and gene-tweaked molds and algae, so anatomically inventive and universally despised that their very presence on the planet has thrown the entire low-rent future into a serious tailspin. So the moon is the place to be, if you're a persecuted "moldie" or an enlightened "flesher" intent an creating a new, more utopian hybrid civilization. Of course up there, there are other intergalactic intelligences to contend with--and some not so intelligent--who have their own agendas and appetites.<br /><br />This is scientific fabulation at its most brazenly inventive--funny, cutting-edge and deeply informed. No writer alive puts it all together like Rudy Rucker.Artificial life forms made of soft plastic and gene-tweaked mold and algae, moldies are evolved robots in the year 2053--anatomically inventive and universally despised. In a sleazy, low-rent future, sexual fraternization with moldies is strictly taboo--a societal sin that is of no concern whatsoever to Randy Karl Tucker. A Kentucky boy who has seriously strayed from the Heritagist religion's stern teachings about the evils of artificial life, Randy feels a definite something for Monique, moldie bookkeeper and maid at the Clearlight Terrace Court Motel But Monique1s sudden and inexplicable abduction from the planet--coupled with unsettling revelations about Randy1s own dubiousorigins--is dragging the degenerate flesher and all those around him into an ugly, conspiratorial mess. . .even as it pulls an unsuspecting humanity ever-closer to a stunning encounter with intergalactic intelligence.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA['A narrative particle accelerator that zooms between Wild Turkey Whiskey and Bob Dylan, unicorn skulls and voracious librarians, John Coltrane and <i>Lord Jim</i>. Science fiction, detective story and post-modern manifesto all rolled into one rip-roaring novel, <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i> is the tour de force that expanded Haruki Murakami's international following. Tracking one man's descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.']]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this final volume of the internationally celebrated MaddAddam trilogy, the Waterless Flood has wiped out most of the population. Toby is part of a small band of survivors, along with the Children of Crake: the gentle, bioengineered quasi-human species who will inherit this new earth.<br /><br />As Toby explains their origins to the curious Crakers, her tales coheres into a luminous oral history that sets down humanity's past--and points toward its future. Blending action, humor, romance, and an imagination at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, <i>MaddAddam</i> is vintage Atwood--a moving and dramatic conclusion to her epic work of speculative fiction.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. <br /><br />Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers...<br /><br />Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away...<br /><br />By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, "The Year of the Flood" is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Simulacra tells of a mid-21st century United States of Europe &amp; America formed by merger of Germany &amp; the USA. The President's an android. Government's a fraud. Superpowers include the French Empire, Chinese People's Republic &amp; Free Africa. Communism exists with Warsaw as its center. A WWIII involving tactical nuclear weapons is mentioned.<br /> There are two classes: Geheimnisträger (secret bearers) &amp; Befehlsträger (instruction implementers). Political &amp; media power are consolidated. Democrats &amp; Republicans merged as the Democrat-Republican Party. NBC, CBS &amp; ABC are the United Triadic Network. Power centers on a permanent 1st Lady, Nicole Thibodeaux, whose consorts are a series of presidents, die Alten. The current der Alte, Rudi Kalbfleisch, is an android. Tho she died decades ago, her role's been held by four actors, the latest being Kate Rupert. This is Geheimnis. Possession of the secret insures elite membership by Ges status.<br /> A secretive governing council controls the USEA. Karp &amp; Söhne Werke, Der Alte's manufacturers, hold some power. The next simulacra contract, for Dieter Hogbein, will go to Frauenzimmer Assoc. Karp &amp; Söhne is unhappy about this new arrangement. They threaten exposure of what's been a state secret for five decades. Nicole dislikes Kalbfleisch. Inbuilt obsolescence means he'll suffer a heart attack &amp; be replaced.<br /> Egon Superb, the last psychotherapist, struggles to practice in a world full of the maladjusted. He encounters difficulties because A. G. Chemie, the leading USEA psycho-pharmaceutical drug cartel, has engineered a psychotherapy prohibition under the MacPhearson Act. The USEA allows him to treat Richard Kongrosian, a pianist performing at the White House. Kongrosian refuses to see anyone as he delusionally thinks his body odor lethal. He exhibits telekinetic abilities. Thibodeaux wants to control his abilities, as do Wilder Pembroke, Nat'l Police head, &amp; members of the covert governance council.<br /> Bertold Goltz, alleged neofascist, seemingly trying to overturn the government, runs Sons of Job, a religious paramilitary organisation. He's actually head of the covert USEA governing council. Ian Duncan loves the 1st Lady, whom he's never met. A subplot includes Charles Strikerock, his brother &amp; a cutrate spacecraft sales firm, Loony Luke's, involved in Mars colonisation. Mars has insectoid life, sentiently empathic papoola, while Ganymede's inhabited by multicellular life.<br /> Nothing is as it seems.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.”</i><br /><br />So begins <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>, an expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem. As our story opens, a mysterious plague has fallen upon the quiet English village of Meryton—and the dead are returning to life! Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace, but she’s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy. What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers—and even more violent sparring on the blood-soaked battlefield. Can Elizabeth vanquish the spawn of Satan? And overcome the social prejudices of the class-conscious landed gentry? Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses,]]></book_description>

In The Man Who Japed, the government's new propaganda minister begins experiencing doubts about the society and his place in it, doubts that are exacerbated when he drunkenly chops the head off a statue of the government's founder.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In Philip Jose Farmers incredible sequel to <i>The Image of the Beast</i>, Herald Childe continues what started as a murder case - a very gruesome one - but which has now become a struggle against the strange and deadly beings who have taken his wife, who threaten his manhood and threaten mankind itself.<br /> His seems a hopeless quest. He is fighting not people but inhuman, unhuman monster from another universe. They take grotesque physical forms, they indulge cruel whims, and they are sex-mad. <br />There is Vivienne, amazingly beautiful, who used to be Joan of Arc. But she has false teeth and she comes literally to pieces. Her lover is a snake-like horror whose needle teeth drip aphrodisiac venom. There is Count Igescu, a real <i>live</i> vampire. And these three are surrounded by a grisly crowd of bizarre aliens, characters in a science fiction nightmare. But for Childe there is to be no waking up: though no one else will believe him, he knows this <i>is for real</i>...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[When Captain Carlsen entered the vast derelict spaceship, he was stunned by its awesome splendor--and shaken by the discovery of its immobilized humanoid passengers.<br /><br />Later, after three of those strange aliens had been transported to Earth, his foreboding was more than justified. The creatures were energy vampires whose seductive embraces were total, whose lust for vitality was boundless. As they took over the willing bodies of their victims and sexual murders spread terror throughout the land, Carlsen worked toward their destruction--even though he was erotically drawn to the most beautiful vampire of all!]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[New York, 1950. A young PR man working at General Electric sold his first magazine piece. By the time he'd sold his third, he decided to quit his job and join the likes of Salinger, Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner, and make a living as a full-time writer. That young man was Kurt Vonnegut.<br /><br /><i>Bagombo Snuff Box</i> collects Vonnegut’s favourite stories from the postwar years that sharpened his dark, vaudevillian and quietly subversive voice. Here we see the mind-bending wit and central themes of his masterpiece, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>. A must-read for Vonnegut aficionados new and old.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Jailbird</i> takes us into a fractured and comic, pure Vonnegut world of high crimes and misdemeanors in government—and in the heart. This wry tale follows bumbling bureaucrat Walter F. Starbuck from Harvard to the Nixon White House to the penitentiary as Watergate’s least known co-conspirator. But the humor turns dark when Vonnegut shines his spotlight on the cold hearts and calculated greed of the mighty, giving a razor-sharp edge to an unforgettable portrait of power and politics in our times.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Deadeye Dick</i> is Vonnegut's funny, chillingly satirical look at the death of innocence. Amid a true Vonnegutian host of horrors—a double murder, a fatal dose of radioactivity, a decapitation, an annihilation of a city by a neutron bomb—Rudy Waltz, a.k.a. Deadeye Dick, takes us along on a zany search for absolution and happiness. Here is a tale of crime and punishment that makes us rethink what we believe and who we say we are.]]></book_description>

But then a voluptuous young widow badgers Rabo into telling his life story—and Vonnegut in turn tells us the plain, heart-hammering truth about man’s careless fancy to create or destroy what he loves.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>
  <b>Slapstick</b>
</i> presents an apocalyptic vision as seen through the eyes of the current King of Manhattan (and last President of the United States), a wickedly irreverent look at the all-too-possible results of today’s follies. But even the end of life-as-we-know-it is transformed by Kurt Vonnegut’s pen into hilarious farce—a final slapstick that may be the Almighty’s joke on us all.]]></book_description>

He's a Vietnam veteran, a jazz pianist, a college professor, and a prognosticator of the apocalypse (and other things Earth-shattering). But that's neither here no there. Because at Tarkington College—where he teaches—the excrement is about to hit the air-conditioning. And its all Eugene's fault.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Γίνεται χρονοσεισμός. Στις 13 Φεβρουαρίου 2001 η ζωή γυρίζει πίσω κατά δέκα ολόκληρα χρόνια και οι άνθρωποι πρέπει να ζήσουν ξανά μια ολόκληρη δεκαετία με τον ίδιο ακριβώς τρόπο, λεπτό το λεπτό, ώρα την ώρα, χρόνο τον χρόνο. Να επαναλάβουν τα ίδια ακριβώς πράγματα, να κάνουν τα ίδια ακριβώς λάθη. Να δουν να ξετυλίγονται οι ίδιες τραγωδίες σαν φάρσες. Δέκα χρόνια deja-vu! Ο χρονοσεισμός τούς έχει αφαιρέσει πλήρως την ελεύθερη βούληση. <br />Κι όλα αυτά γιατί; Διότι έτσι το θέλησε ο Κίλγκορ Τράουτ, ένας γέρος συγγραφέας βιβλίων επιστημονικής φαντασίας που δεν κυκλοφορούν πια, το alter ego του Βόννεγκατ.<br />Όταν κάποτε η ισορροπία του σύμπαντος θα αποκατασταθεί, όλοι θα ζήσουν ξανά τη ζωή τους σε πρώτη προβολή, κάτι που προϋποθέτει να τεθεί ξανά σε λειτουργία το μυαλό τους. Και τότε τα πράγματα θα αρχίσουν κι άλλο να μπερδεύονται...]]></book_description>

Paul’s rebellion is vintage Vonnegut—wildly funny, deadly serious, and terrifyingly close to reality.<br /><br /><i>Alternate cover edition <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25848915-player-piano" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Second only to <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> of Vonnegut's canon in its prominence and influence, <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i> (1965) presents Eliot Rosewater, an itinerant, semi-crazed millionaire wandering the country in search of heritage and philanthropic outcome, introducing the science fiction writer Kilgore Trout to the world and Vonnegut to the collegiate audience which would soon make him a cult writer.<br /><br />Trout, modeled according to Vonnegut on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (with whom Vonnegut had an occasional relationship) is a desperate, impoverished but visionary hack writer who functions for Eliot Rosewater as both conscience and horrid example. Rosewater, seeking to put his inheritance to some meaningful use (his father was an entrepreneur), tries to do good within the context of almost illimitable cynicism and corruption.<br /><br />It is in this novel that Rosewater wanders into a science fiction conference--an actual annual event in Milford, Pennsylvania--and at the motel delivers his famous monologue evoked by science fiction writers and critics for almost half a century: "None of you can write for sour apples... but you're the only people trying to come to terms with the really terrific things which are happening today." Money does not drive Mr. Rosewater (or the corrupt lawyer who tries to shape the Rosewater fortune) so much as outrage at the human condition. <br /><br />The novel was adapted for a 1979 Alan Menken musical. The novel is told mostly thru a collection of short stories dealing with Eliot's interactions with the citizens of Rosewater County, usually with the last sentence serving as a punch line. The antagonist's tale, Mushari's, is told in a similar short essay fashion. The stories reveal different hypocrisies of humankind in a darkly humorous fashion.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality. The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side. Of course there's a catch to the invitation—and a prophetic vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Galápagos</i> takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry—and all that is worth saving.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This short-story collection <i>Welcome to the Monkey House</i> (1968) incorporates almost completely Vonnegut's 1961 "Canary in a Cathouse", which appeared within a few months of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> and capitalized upon that breakthrough novel and the enormous attention it suddenly brought.<br /><br />Drawn from both specialized science fiction magazines and the big-circulation general magazines which Vonnegut had been one of the few science writers to sell, the collection includes some of his most accomplished work from 1950 to 1968. The title story may be his most famous—a diabolical government asserts control through compulsory technology removing orgasm from sex—but Vonnegut's bitterness and wit, not in his earlier work as poisonous or unshielded as it later became, is well demonstrated.<br /><br />Two early stories from Galaxy science fiction magazine and one from Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (the famous "Harrison Bergeron") show Vonnegut's careful command of a genre about which he was always ambivalent, stories like "More Stately Mansions" or "The Foster Portfolio" the confines and formula of a popular fiction of which he was always suspicious. Vonnegut's affection for humanity and bewilderment as its corruption are manifest in these early works.<br /><br />Several of these stories (those which appeared in Collier's) were commissioned by Vonnegut's Cornell classmate and great supporter Knox Burger, also born in 1922.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Where I Live / Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (variant of You've Never Been to Barnstable?)<br />Harrison Bergeron / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Who Am I This Time? / Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (variant of My Name Is Everyone)<br />Welcome to the Monkey House / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Long Walk to Forever / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Foster Portfolio / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Miss Temptation / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />All the King's Horses / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Tom Edison's Shaggy Dog / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />New Dictionary / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Next Door / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />More Stately Mansions / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Hyannis Port Story / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />D.P. / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Report on the Barnhouse Effect / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Euphio Question / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Go Back to Your Precious Wife and Son / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Deer in the Works / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Lie / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Unready to Wear / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Kid Nobody Could Handle (George M.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Charlie Johns has been snatched from his home on 61 North 34th Street and delivered to the strange future world of Ledom. Here, violence is a vague and improbable notion. Technology has triumphed over hunger, overpopulation, pollution, even time and space. But there is a change Charlie finds even more shocking: gender is a thing of the past. <b>Venus Plus X</b> is Theodore Sturgeon's brilliant evocation of a civilization for whom tensions between male and female and the human preoccupation with sex no longer exist. <br /><br />As Charlie Johns explores Ledom and its people, he finds that the human precepts he holds dear are profane in this new world. But has Charlie learned all there is to know about this advanced society? And why are the Ledom so intent on gaining Charlie's approval? Unsettling, compelling, and no less than visionary, here is science fiction at its boldest: a novel whose wisdom and lyricism make it one of the most original and insightful speculations on gender ever produced.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[There's Lone, the simpleton who can hear other people's thoughts and make a man blow his brains out just by looking at him. There's Janie, who moves things without touching them, and there are the teleporting twins, who can travel ten feet or ten miles. There's Baby, who invented an antigravity engine while still in the cradle, and Gerry, who has everything it takes to run the world except for a conscience. Separately, they are talented freaks. Together, they compose a single organism that may represent the next step in evolution, and the final chapter in the history of the human race.<br /><br />In this genre-bending novel - among the first to have launched scifi into the arena of literature - one of the great imaginers of the twentieth century tells a story as mind-blowing as any controlled substance and as affecting as a glimpse into a stranger's soul. For as the protagonists of <i>More Than Human</i> struggle to find who they are and whether they are meant to help humanity or destroy it. Theodore Sturgeon explores questions of power and morality, individuality and belonging, with suspense, pathos, and a lyricism rarely seen in science fiction.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Set the controls for the heart of the sun.<br /><br />The Captain bent in the warm air, cursing, felt his hands run over the cold machine, and while he worked he saw a future which was removed from them by the merest breath.

    <book_description><![CDATA[The mind of Ray Bradbury is a wonder-filled carnival of delight and terror that stretches from the verdant Irish countryside to the coldest reaches of outer space. Yet all his work is united by one common thread: a vivid and profound understanding of the vast set of emotions that bring strength and mythic resonance to our frail species. Ray Bradbury characters may find themselves anywhere and anywhen. A horrified mother may give birth to a strange blue pyramid. A man may take Abraham Lincoln out of the grave—and meet another who puts him back. An amazing Electrical Grandmother may come to live with a grieving family. An old parrot may have learned over long evenings to imitate the voice of Ernest Hemingway, and became the last link to the great man. A priest on Mars may confront his fondest dream: to meet the Messiah. Each of these magnificent creations has something to tell us about our humanity—and all of their fates await you in this new trade edition of twenty-eight classic Bradbury stories and one luscious poem. Travel on an unpredictable and unforgettable literary journey—safe in the hands of one of the century's great men of imagination.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[That <i>The Illustrated Man</i> has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was <i>Dark Carnival</i>, later reworked into <i>The October Country</i>), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as "The Veldt," wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or "Kaleidoscope," a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or "Zero Hour," in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i><br /><br />Contents:<br />Prologue: The Illustrated Man (1951)<br />The Veldt (1950)<br />Kaleidoscope (1949)<br />The Other Foot (1951)<br />The Highway (1950)<br />The Man (1949)<br />The Long Rain (1950)<br />The Rocket Man (1951)<br />The Fire Balloons (1951)<br />The Last Night of the World (1951)<br />The Exiles (1949)<br />No Particular Night or Morning (1951)<br />The Fox and the Forest (1950)<br />The Visitor (1948)<br />The Concrete Mixer (1949)<br />Marionettes, Inc. (1949)<br />The City (1950)<br />Zero Hour (1947)<br />The Rocket (1950)<br />Epilogue (The Illustrated Man) (1951)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The summer of '28 was a vintage season for a growing boy. A summer of green apple trees, mowed lawns, and new sneakers. Of half-burnt firecrackers, of gathering dandelions, of Grandma's belly-busting dinner. It was a summer of sorrows and marvels and gold-fuzzed bees. A magical, timeless summer in the life of a twelve-year-old boy named Douglas Spaulding—remembered forever by the incomparable Ray Bradbury.<br /><br />Woven into the novel are the following short stories: Illumination, Dandelion Wine, Summer in the Air, Season of Sitting, The Happiness Machine, The Night, The Lawns of Summer, Season of Disbelief, The Last--the Very Last, The Green Machine, The Trolley, Statues, The Window, The Swan, The Whole Town's Sleeping, Goodbye Grandma, The Tarot Witch, Hotter Than Summer, Dinner at Dawn, The Magical Kitchen, Green Wine for Dreaming.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[One of Ray Bradbury’s best-known and most popular novels, <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, now featuring a new introduction and material about its longstanding influence on culture and genre.<br /><br />For those who still dream and remember, for those yet to experience the hypnotic power of its dark poetry, step inside. The show is about to begin. Cooger &amp; Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show has come to Green Town, Illinois, to destroy every life touched by its strange and sinister mystery. The carnival rolls in sometime after midnight, ushering in Halloween a week early. A calliope’s shrill siren song beckons to all with a seductive promise of dreams and youth regained. Two boys will discover the secret of its smoke, mazes, and mirrors; two friends who will soon know all too well the heavy cost of wishes…and the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />Few novels have endured in the heart and memory as has Ray Bradbury’s unparalleled literary masterpiece <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>. Scary and suspenseful, it is a timeless classic in the American canon.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The strange and wonderful tale of man’s experiences on Mars, filled with intense images and astonishing visions. Now part of the Voyager Classics collection.<br /><br />The Martian Chronicles tells the story of humanity’s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a fist. They felt they had never been born. Those few that survived found no welcome on Mars. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up.<br /><br />But more rockets arrived from Earth, and more, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them – and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams. These were soon inhabited by the strange native beings, with their caged flowers and birds of flame.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Rocket Summer<br />Ylla<br />The Summer Night<br />The Earth Men<br />The Taxpayer<br />The Third Expedition<br />-And the Moon Be Still As Bright<br />The Settlers<br />The Green Morning<br />The Locusts<br />Night Meeting<br />The Shore<br />Interim<br />The Musicians<br />Way in the Middle of the Air<br />The Naming of Names<br />Usher II<br />The Old Ones<br />The Martian<br />The Luggage Store<br />The Off Season<br />The Watchers<br />The Silent Towns<br />The Long Years<br />There Will Come Soft Rains<br />The Million Year Picnic]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fahrenheit 451 ofrece la historia de un sombrío y horroroso futuro. Montag, el protagonista, pertenece a una extraña brigada de bomberos cuya misión, paradójicamente, no es la de sofocar incendios sino la de provocarlos, para quemar libros. Porque en el país de Montag está terminantemente prohibido leer. Porque leer obliga a pensar, y en el país de Montag esta prohibido pensar. Porque leer impide ser ingenuamente feliz, y en el país de Montag hay que ser feliz a la fuerza...]]></book_description>

Its all part of an insidious plot thats about to ensnare Della Taze--who doesnt think she killed her lover while in drug-induced ecstasy. . .but isnt sure. And its certainly catastrophic enough to call Cobb Anderson--the pheezer who started it all--out of cold-storage heaven.<p></p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Cobb Anderson created the "boppers," sentient robots that overthrew their human overlords. But now Cobb is just an aging alcoholic waiting to die, and the big boppers are threatening to absorb all of the little boppers--and eventually every human--into a giant, melded consciousness. Some of the little boppers aren't too keen on the idea, and a full-scale robot revolt is underway on the moon (where the boppers live). Meanwhile, bopper Ralph Numbers wants to give Cobb immortality by letting a big bopper slice up his brain and tape his "software." It seems like a good idea to Cobb.]]></book_description>

As the Old Empire crumbles into barbarism throughout the million worlds of the galaxy, Hari Seldon and his band of psychologists must create a new entity, the Foundation-dedicated to art, science, and technology-as the beginning of a new empire. <br /><br />FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE describes the mighty struggle for power amid the chaos of the stars in which man stands at the threshold of a new enlightened life which could easily be destroyed by the old forces of barbarism. <br /><br />SECOND FOUNDATION follows the Seldon Plan after the First Empire's defeat and describes its greatest threat-a dangerous mutant strain gone wild, which produces a mind capable of bending men's wills, directing their thoughts, reshaping their desires, and destroying the universe.]]></book_description>

It is over a century since the world was devastated by nuclear war, but the blight of radioactivity and disease still gnaws away at the survivors. The expedition expects to find physical destruction but they are quite unprepared for the moral degradation they meet. <i>Ape and Essence</i> is Huxley's vision of the ruin of humanity, told with all his knowledge and imaginative genius.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In <em>Island</em>, his last novel, Huxley transports us to a Pacific island where, for 120 years, an ideal society has flourished. Inevitably, this island of bliss attracts the envy and enmity of the surrounding world. A conspiracy is underway to take over Pala, and events begin to move when an agent of the conspirators, a newspaperman named Faranby, is shipwrecked there. What Faranby doesn't expect is how his time with the people of Pala will revolutionize all his values and—to his amazement—give him hope.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Brave New World</i> is a dystopian novel by English author Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State, inhabited by genetically modified citizens and an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by only a single individual: the story's protagonist.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Objective, unbiased and hyper-rational, the Vulcan 3 should have been the perfect ruler. The omnipotent computer dictates policy that is in the best interests of all citizens — or at least, that is the idea. But when the machine, whose rule evolved out of chaos and war, begins to lose control of the “Healer” movement of religious fanatics and the mysterious force behind their rebellion, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For all the strange worlds borne of his vast and vivid imagination, Philip K. Dick was largely concerned with humanity’s most achingly familiar heartaches and struggles. In <b>Our Friends From Frolix 8</b>, he clashes private dreams against public battles in a fast-paced and provocative tale that ultimately addresses our salvation both as individuals and a whole.<br /><br />Nick Appleton is a menial laborer whose life is a series of endless frustrations. Willis Gram is the despotic oligarch of a planet ruled by big-brained elites. When they both fall in love with Charlotte Boyer, a feisty black marketer of revolutionary propaganda, Nick seems destined for doom. But everything takes a decidedly unpredictable turn when the revolution’s leader, Thors Provoni, returns from ten years of intergalactic hiding with a ninety-ton protoplasmic slime that is bent on creating a new world order. <br /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Yielding to a compulsion he can't explain, Ted Barton interrupts his vacation in order to visit the town of his birth, Millgate, Virginia. But upon entering the sleepy, isolated little hamlet, Ted is distraught to find that the place bears no resemblance to the one he left behind--and never did. He also discovers that in this Millgate Ted Barton died of scarlet fever when he was nine years old. Perhaps even more troubling is the fact that it is literally impossible to escape. Unable to leave, Ted struggles to find the reason for such disturbing incongruities, but before long, he finds himself in the midst of a struggle between good and evil that stretches far beyond the confines of the valley.<br /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino.

    <book_description><![CDATA[In <i>The Crack in Space</i>, a repairman discovers that a hole in a faulty Jifi-scuttler leads to a parallel world. Jim Briskin, campaigning to be the first black president of the United States, thinks alter-Earth is the solution to the chronic overpopulation that has seventy million people cryogenically frozen; Tito Cravelli, a shadowy private detective, wants to know why Dr Lurton Sands is hiding his mistress on the planet; billionaire mutant George Walt wants to make the empty world all his own. But when the other earth turns out to be inhabited, everything changes.<br /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Scalding sarcastic yet enduringly empathetic, "The Zap Gun"is Dick's remarkable novel depicting the insanity of the arms race. Lars Powderdry and Lilo Topchev are counterpart weapons fashion designers for a world divided into two factions - Wes-bloc and Peep-East. Since the Plowshare Protocols of 2002, their job has been to invent elaborate weapons that only seem massively lethal. But when alien satellites hostile to both sides appear in the sky, the two are brought together in the dire hope that they can create a weapon to save the world, a task made all the more difficult by Lars falling in love with Lilo even as he knows she's trying to kill him.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Floyd Jones is sullen, ungainly, and quite possibly mad, but in a very short time he will rise from telling fortunes at a mutant carnival to convulsing an entire planet. For although Jones has the power to see the future — a power that makes his life a torment — his real gift lies elsewhere: in his ability to make people dream again in a world where dreaming has been made illegal, even when the dream is indistinguishable from a nightmare.<br /><br />In Philip K. Dick's unsettling chronicle of the rise and fall of a postnuclear messiah, readers will find a novel that is as minutely realistic as it is prophetic. For along with its engineered mutants, hermaphroditic sex performers, and protoplasmic drifters from the stars, <i>The World Jones Made</i> gives us nothing less than a deadly accurate reading of our own hunger for belief.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The operating principle was random selection: positions of public power were decided by a sophisticated lottery and when the magnetic lottery bottle twitched, anyone could become the absolute ruler of the world, the Quizmaster.<br /><br />But with the power came the game – the assassination game – which everyone could watch on TV. Would the new man be good enough to evade his chosen killer? Which made for fascinating and exciting viewing, compelling enough to distract the public’s attention while the Big Five industrial complexes ran the world. Then, in 2203, with the choice of a member of a maverick cult as Quizmaster, the system developed a little hitch…<br /><br /><i>Solar Lottery</i> was Philip K. Dick’s first published novel, brilliant and idiosyncratic, powerful and affecting.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In <i>Counter-Clock World</i>, one of the most theologically probing of all of Dick’s books, the world has entered the Hobart Phase — a vast sidereal process in which time moves in reverse. As a result, libraries are busy eradicating books, copulation signifies the end of pregnancy, people greet with, “Good-bye,” and part with, “Hello,” and underneath the world’s tombstones, the dead are coming back to life. One imminent old-born is Anarch Peak, a vibrant religious leader whose followers continued to flourish long after his death. His return from the dead has such awesome implications that those who apprehend him will very likely be those who control the fate of the world.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A masterwork by Philip K. Dick, this is the final, expanded version of the novella <i>The Unteleported Man</i>, which Dick worked on shortly before his death. In <i>Lies, Inc.</i>, fans of the science fiction legend will immediately recognize his hallmark themes of life in a security state, conspiracy, and the blurring of reality and illusion. This publication marks its first complete appearance in the United States.<br /><br />In this wry, paranoid vision of the future, overpopulation has turned cities into cramed industrial anthills. For those sick of this dystopian reality, one corporation, Trails of Hoffman, Inc., promises an alternative: Take a teleport to Whale's Mouth, a colonized planet billed as the supreme paradise. The only catch is that you can never comeback. When a neurotic man named Rachmael ben Applebaum discovers that the promotional films of happy crowds cheering their newfound existence on Whale's Mouth are faked, he decides to pilot a scapeship on the eighteen-year journey there to see if anyone wants to return.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this sardonically funny gem of speculative fiction, Philip K. Dick creates a novel that manages to be simultaneously unpredictable and perversely logical. Poor Pete Garden has just lost Berkeley. He's also lost his wife, but he'll get a new one as soon as he rolls a three. It's all part of the rules of Bluff, the game that's become a blinding obsession for the last inhabitants of the planet Earth. But the rules are about to change--drastically and terminally--because Pete Garden will be playing his next game against an opponent who isn't even human, for stakes that are a lot higher than Berkeley.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fourteen strangers come to Delmak-O. Thirteen of them were transferred by the usual authorities. One got there by praying. But once they arrived on that treacherous planet, whose very atmosphere seemed to induce paranoia and psychosis, the newcomers tound that even prayer was useless. For on Delmak-O, God is either absent or intent on destroying His creations. At once a wrenching metaphysical thriller and an ingenious meditation on the nature of divinity, <i>A Maze of Death</i> is Philip K. Dick at his most dizzyingly provocative.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dr. Eric Sweetscent has problems. His planet is enmeshed in an unwinnable war. His wife is lethally addicted to a drug that whips its users helplessly back and forth across time -- and is hell-bent on making Eric suffer along with her. And Sweetscent's newest patient is not only the most important man on the embattled planet Earth but quite possibly the sickest. For Secretary Gino Molinari has turned his mortal illness into an instrument of political policy -- and Eric cannot tell if his job is to make the man better or to keep him poised just this side of death.<br /><br />Now Wait for Last Year bursts through the envelope between the impossible and the inevitable. Even as it ushers us into a future that looks uncannily like the present, it makes the normal seem terrifyingly provisional -- and compels anyone who reads it to wonder if he really knows what time it is.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Glimmung wants Joe Fernwright. Fernwright is a pot-healer - a repairer of ceramics - in a drably utilitarian future where such skills have little value. And the Glimmung? The Glimmung is a being that looks something like a gyroscope, something like a teenaged girl, and something like the contents of an ocean. What's more, it may be divine. And, like certain gods of old Earth, it has a bad temper.<br /><br />What could an omnipresent and seemingly omnipotent entity want with a humble pot-healer? Or with the dozens of other odd creatures it has lured to Plowman's Planet? And if the Glimmung is a god, are its ends positive or malign? Combining quixotic adventure, spine-chilling horror, and deliriously paranoid theology, <i>Galactic Pot-Healer</i> is a uniquely Dickian voyage to alternate worlds of the imagination.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

For fifteen years, subterranean humanity has been fed on daily broadcasts of a never-ending nuclear destruction, sustained by a belief in the all powerful Protector. But up on Earth's surface, a different kind of reality reigns. East and West are at peace. Across the planet, an elite corps of expert hoaxers preserve the lie.<br /><br />Cover Illustration: Chris Moore]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Louis Rosen and his partners sell people--ingeniously designed, historically authentic simulacra of personages such as Edwin M. Stanton and Abraham Lincoln. The problem is that the only prospective buyer is a rapacious billionaire whose plans for the simulacra could land Louis in jail. Then there's the added complication that someone--or something--like Abraham Lincoln may not want to be sold.<br /><br />Is an electronic Lincoln any less alive than his creators? Is a machine that cares and suffers inferior to the woman Louis loves--a borderline psychopath who does neither? With irresistible momentum, intelligence, and wit, Philip K. Dick creates an arresting techno-thriller that suggests a marriage of <i>Bladerunner</i> and <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An abandoned satellite holds two worlds at bay. Holding a precarious liberty as the result of an interstellar stalemate, the human survivors of Alpha Centauri's hospital moon readied themselves for their war of independence. Naturally, the Pares, always suspicious and cunning, assumed the leadership, leaving it to the Manses to provide the super weapons out of their sheer love of violence. Propaganda and other details would have to be left to the Skitzes, the Heebs, the Polys, and the Ob-Coms. But when the Earth expedition arrived, everything turned out to be different -- because they too were divided among themselves, and some of them weren't really human at a all!]]></book_description>
