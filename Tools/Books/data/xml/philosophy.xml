Randomly feeding esoteric bits of knowledge into an incredible computer capable of inventing connections between all their entires, they think they are creating a long lazy game--until the game starts taking over....<br />Here is an incredible journey of thought and history, memory and fantasy, a tour de force as enthralling as anything Umberto Eco--or indeed anyone--has ever devised.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Sometimes a writer has to revisit the classics, and here we find that "gonzo journalism"—gutsy first-person accounts wherein the author is part of the story—didn't originate with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5237.Hunter_S__Thompson" title="Hunter S. Thompson" rel="nofollow noopener">Hunter S. Thompson</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3083854.Tom_Wolfe" title="Tom Wolfe" rel="nofollow noopener">Tom Wolfe</a>. Aldous Huxley took some mescaline &amp; wrote about it some 10 or 12 years earlier than those others. The book he came up with is part bemused essay &amp; part mystical treatise—"suchness" is everywhere to be found while under the influence. This is a good example of essay writing, journal keeping &amp; the value of controversy—always—in one's work.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23272740-the-outsider" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</i><br /><br /><i>The Outsider</i> is the seminal work on alienation, creativity and the modern mind-set. First published over forty years ago, it made its youthful author England's most controversial intellectual. The Outsider its an individual engaged in an intense self-exploration—a person who lives at the edge, challenges cultural values and "stands for Truth." Born into a world without perspective, where others simply drift thru life, the Outsider creates his own set of rules and lives them in an unsympathetic environment. The relative handful of people who fulfilled Wilson's definition of the Outsider in the 1950s have now become a significant social force, making Wilson's vision more relevant today than ever. Through the works the lives of various artists—including Kafka, Camus, Eliot, Hemingway, Hesse, Lawrence, Van Gogh, Nijinsky, Shaw, Blake, Nietzsche and Dostoyevski—Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society and society's effect on him. Wilson illuminates the struggle of those who seek not only the transformation of Self but also the transformation of society as a whole. The book is essential for everyone who shares his conviction that "a new religion is needed".]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[We think the way we do because Socrates thought the way he did; in his unwavering commitment to truth and in the example of his own life, he set the standard for all subsequent Western philosophy. And yet, for twenty-five centuries, he has remained an enigma: a man who left no written legacy and about whom everything we know is hearsay, gleaned from the writings of Plato, Xenophon and Aristophanes. Now Bettany Hughes gives us an unprecedented, brilliantly vivid portrait of Socrates and of his homeland, Athens in its Golden Age.<br /><br />His life spanned “seventy of the busiest, most wonderful and tragic years in Athenian history.” It was a city devastated by war, but, at the same time, transformed by the burgeoning process of democracy, and Hughes re-creates this fifth-century B.C. city, drawing on the latest sourcesâ€”archaeological, topographical and textualâ€”to illuminate the streets where Socrates walked, to place him there and to show us the world as he experienced it. <br /><br />She takes us through the great, teeming Agoraâ€”the massive marketplace, the heart of ancient Athensâ€”where Socrates engaged in philosophical dialogue and where he would be condemned to death. We visit the battlefields where he fought, the red-light district and gymnasia he frequented and the religious festivals he attended. We meet the men and the few womenâ€”including his wife, Xanthippe, and his “inspiration” and confidante, Aspasiaâ€”who were central to his life. We travel to where he was born and where he died. And we come to understand the profound influences of time and place in the evolution of his eternally provocative philosophy.<br /><br />Deeply informed and vibrantly written, combining historical inquiry and storytelling Ã©lan, <i>The Hemlock Cup</i> gives us the most substantial, fascinating, humane depiction we have ever had of one of the most influential thinkers of all time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The mystic's moment of illumination shares with great poetry the liberating power of the deepest levels of consciousness. In the words of William Blake, "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to a man as it is, infinite."<br /><br />Poetry, Wilson argues, is a contradiction of the habitual prison of daily life and shows the way to transcend the ordinary world through an act of intense attention-and intention. The poet, like the mystic, is subject to sudden ""peak experiences"" when ""everything we look upon is blessed."" W.B. Yeats, Dostoevsky, Gautama Buddha, Kazantzakis, Van Gogh, Rupert Brooke, Arunja, Nietzsche, A.L. Rouse, Jacob Boehme, Suzuki, Edgar Allan Poe: their visionary understanding can generate an awareness in each of us of our potential to open the floodgates of inner energy that creates mystic experience.<br /><br />Colin Wilson first received international acclaim in 1956 for The Outsider. ""Ever since I was thirteen, I have been obsessed by the question of the nature of mystical experience,"" he writes, and from that time he has been on a quest of the mystical in poetry, religion, and psychology.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["It's déjà vu all over again"—only better. <i>The Yogi Book</i>, the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, now has a fresh new design throughout, new photographs, a career timeline, and all-new appreciations by some of his greatest fans, including Billy Crystal. And it's timed to coincide with the 85th birthday of this American legend who's more beloved than ever.<br /><br />As for the quotes, well, Yogi Berra's gift for saying the smartest things in the funniest, most memorable ways has made him a legend. Or, as <i>The New Yorker</i> put it, "Hardly anybody would quarrel that . . . Winston Churchill has been replaced by Yogi Berra as the favorite source of quotations." <i>The Yogi Book</i> brings all of his famous quotes together in one place—and even better, gives the story behind them. "It ain't over 'til it's over."—that’s Yogi's answer to a reporter when he was managing the Mets in July 1973, and they were nine games out of first place (not only quotable, but prophetic—they won the pennant). "Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded."—Yogi's comment to Stan Musial and Joe Garagiola about Ruggieri's Restaurant in St. Louis 1959. "It gets late early out there."—Yogi describing how shadows crept across Yankee Stadium's left field during late autumn afternoons. <br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This manual uses material from <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> for this preparation. The authors also make an important contribution to the interpretation of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead.</i> They show that it is concerned not with the dead, but with the living. The last section of the manual provides instructions for an actual psychedelic session, under adequate safeguards.<br /><br />The authors were engaged in a program of experiments with LSD and other psychedelic drugs at Harvard University until sensational national publicity unfairly concentrating on student interest in the drugs, led to the suspension of the experiments. Since then, the authors have continued their work without academic auspices.]]></book_description>

Their mental journey into the very core of the universe is so well supported by facts that its fantasy becomes superbly plausible and wonderfully frightening.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Irreverent, thought-provoking and hilarious, Leary's parting shot pioneers new ways to die and new ways for the living to think about death. Urging us to take control of our deaths (and even to determine when and how we will die). Leary relates his own plan for "directed dying," a death we plan and orchestrate to reflect our own lives and values.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Stimulating and often startling discussions between three friends, all highly original thinkers: Rupert Sheldrake, controversial biologist, Terence McKenna , psychedelic visionary, and Ralph Abraham , chaos mathematician. Their passion is to break out of paradigms that retard our evolution and to explore new possibilities. Through challenge and synergy they venture where few have gone before, leading their readers on an exciting journey of discovery. Their discussions focus on the evolution of the mind, the role of psychedelics, skepticism, the psychic powers of animals, the structure of time, the life of the heavens, the nature of God, and transformations of consciousness.<br /><br />“Three fine thinkers take us plunging into the universe of chaos, mind, and spirit. Instead of leaving us lost, they bring us back with startling insights and more wonder than we knew we had.” —Matthew Fox, <i>Original Blessing and Sheer Joy</i><br /><br />"A jam-session of the mind, an intellectual movable feast, an on-going conversation that began over twenty years ago and remains as lively and relevant today as it ever was. Sadly, Terence had to leave the conversation a little earlier than planned. But the appearance of this book of trialogues at this critical, historical juncture is a reaffirmation of the potency of the optimistic vision that the trialogues express." —Dennis McKenna, brother of the late Terence McKenna<br /><br />Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author of many books including <i>The Sense of Being Stared At, And Other Aspects of the Extended Mind</i>. Ralph Abraham is a mathematician, one of the pioneers of chaos theory and the author of several books including <i>Chaos, Gaia, Eros: A Chaos Pioneer Uncovers the Three Great Streams of History.</i> The late Terence McKenna was a scholar of shamanism, ethno-botanist, psychedelic researcher and author of many books including <i>Food of the Gods and True Hallucinations</i>.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the book's Contents page:<br /><br />"These reflections on human personality are rooted in three sources of observation and data: the clinic, the life story, the assessment method. The struggle of contraries and dualities in human nature is seen as a fruitful source of growth. The perspective is that of contemporary humanistic psychology, anchored in the early twentieth century theories of pragmatism, gestalt psychology, and creative evolution. This gives a central place to the philosophy of values and of moral development, considered scientifically, and makes choice the decisive factor in growth and evolution.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Divine obfuscation has a purpose. This is the classic that ushered in so many imitators, imitators who did not get "it." "It" is slack, the desiderata that cannot be desired and is only attainable through "Bob," the evil god/male model who founded the Church of the SubGenius without bothering to "exist." If you read this holy book properly, you will learn to "pull the wool over your own eyes." While this volume may seem hilarious, it's also an incredibly adept deconstruction of religion in general and the human impulse to believe in and follow anyone who promises to give their lives meaning and structure. Plus, it's the only place to find the information you need to survive when the bad alien gods come out of the sky to kill, enslave, and entertain us. If you don't already have a copy, then hand in your hipness ID card and hang your head in shame.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Using an inspired combination of geometric logic and metaphors from familiar human experience, Bucky invites readers to join him on a trip through a four-dimensional Universe, where concepts as diverse as entropy, Einstein's relativity equations, and the meaning of existence become clear, understandable, and immediately involving. In his own words: "Dare to be naive... It is one of our most exciting discoveries that local discovery leads to a complex of further discoveries."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this essay on man Mr. Fuller expresses what may well be his penultimate view of the human condition. Here, in a mood at once philosophical and involved, Mr. Fuller traces man's intellectual evolution and weighs his capability for survival on this magnificent craft, this Spaceship Earth, this superbly designed sphere of almost negligible dimension in the great vastness of space.<br />Mr. Fuller is optimistic that man will survive and, through research and development and increased industrialization, generate wealth so rapidly that he can do very great things. But, he notes, there must be an enormous educational task successfully accomplished right now to convert man's tendency toward oblivion into a realization of his potential, to a universe-exploring advantage from this Spaceship Earth.<br />It has been noted that Mr. Fuller spins ideas in clusters, and clusters of his ideas generate still other clusters. The concept spaceship earth is Mr. Fuller's, and though used by Barbara Ward as the title of a work of her own the idea was acknowledged by her there as deriving from Mr. Fuller. The brilliant syntheses of some fundamental Fuller principles given here makes of this book a microcosm of the Fuller system.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[R. Buckminster Fuller is regarded as one of the most important figures of the 20th century, renowned for his achievements as an inventor, designer, architect, philosopher, mathematician, and dogged individualist. Perhaps best remembered for the Geodesic Dome and the term "Spaceship Earth," his work and his writings have had a profound impact on modern life and thought.<br /><br /><i>Critical Path</i> is Fuller's master work--the summing up of a lifetime's thought and concern--as urgent and relevant as it was upon its first publication in 1981. <i>Critical Path</i> details how humanity found itself in its current situation--at the limits of the planet's natural resources and facing political, economic, environmental, and ethical crises.<br /><br />The crowning achievement of an extraordinary career, <i>Critical Path</i> offers the reader the excitement of understanding the essential dilemmas of our time and how responsible citizens can rise to meet this ultimate challenge to our future.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This unconventional and lighthearted introduction to the ideas of the major Western philosophers examines The Simpsons — TV’s favorite animated family. The authors look beyond the jokes, the crudeness, the attacks on society — and see a clever display of irony, social criticism, and philosophical thought. The writers begin with an examination of the characters. Does Homer actually display Aristotle’s virtues of character? In what way does Bart exemplify American pragmatism? The book also examines the ethics and themes of the show, and concludes with discussions of how the series reflects the work of Aristotle, Marx, Camus, Sartre, and other thinkers.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this classic work that continues to inspire its many readers, James Lovelock deftly explains his idea that life on earth functions as a single organism. Written for the non-scientist, <em>Gaia</em> is a journey through time and space in search of evidence with which to support a new and radically different model of our planet. In contrast to conventional belief that living matter is passive in the face of threats to its existence, the book explores the hypothesis that the earth's living matter-air, ocean, and land surfaces-forms a complex system that has the capacity to keep the Earth a fit place for life.<br /> Since <em>Gaia</em> was first published, many of Jim Lovelock's predictions have come true, and his theory has become a hotly argued topic in scientific circles. Here, in a new Preface, Lovelock outlines his present state of the debate.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, James Lovelock proposed a new theory of life: the Earth, its rocks, oceans, atmosphere, and all living things are part of one great organism, evolving over the vast span of geological time. Here, he examines environmental and scientific issues in detail, including the greenhouse effect, acid rain, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the destruction of tropical forests. For this second edition he has updated the text throughout and added a new chapter on advances in our scientific knowledge. He sounds a warning of the damage man is doing to the health of the planet.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Three of the most original thinkers of our time explore issues that call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life. <br /><br />• A wide-ranging investigation of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos theory in the dynamics of human creation, and the rediscovery of traditional wisdom. <br /><br />In this book of "trialogues," the late psychedelic visionary and shamanologist Terence McKenna, acclaimed biologist and originator of the morphogenetic fields theory Rupert Sheldrake, and mathematician and chaos theory scientist Ralph Abraham explore the relationships between chaos and creativity and their connection to cosmic consciousness. Their observations call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life in the universe. The authors challenge the reader to the deepest levels of thought with wide-ranging investigations of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos in the dynamics of human creation, and the resacralization of the world. Among the provocative questions the authors raise are: Is Armageddon a self-fulfilling prophecy? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined? Are the eternal laws of nature still evolving? What is the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness? <br /><br />Part ceremony, part old-fashioned intellectual discussion, these trialogues are an invitation to a new understanding of what Jean Houston calls "the dreamscapes of our everyday waking life."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Twenty-three essays by young professional philosophers examine crucial ethical and metaphysical aspects of the Buffyverse (the world of Buffy). Though the show already attracted much scholarly attention, this is the first book to fully disinter the intellectual issues. Designed by Whedon as a multilevel story with most of its meanings deeply buried in heaps of heavy irony, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has replaced The X-Files as the show that explains to Americans the nature of the powerful forces of evil continually threatening to surge into our world of everyday decency and overwhelm it. In the tradition of the classic horror films Buffy the Vampire Slayer addresses ethical issues that have long fascinated audiences. This book draws out the ethical and metaphysical lessons from a pop-culture phenomenon.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Timothy Leary, Ph.D.</i> has been a world-renowned psychologist, a defrocked Harvard professor, a relentless champion of brain change, a reputed drug guru, a stand-up philosopher, and a prisoner of the Nixon administration. He has been called 'the most dangerous man on the planet.'<br /><br />While in prison, at time in solitary confinement, he wrote the first version of this book. ("I must confess that at that time I was alienated, a bit daft and given to occasional fits of irritation. So color the first version of this book indigo—as in Jail House Blues.") Now revised and updated, <i>Neuropolitique</i> presents some of Dr. Leary's best ideas, his reflections on the past and his hope for the future.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Written in 70s with all the influence of the wild and counterculture rebelliousness of the 60s, The Game of Life reflects the depth of mind of one of the unique human beings of the 20th century. From famed psychologist and Harvard professor to LSD Guru, to stage and film star, computer junky, and more. Tim leaves no stone, or for that matter, person unturned. As an unrepentant advocate of personal freedom and development, he was on a mission to wake humanity up, to encourage us to use our brains and open our minds up to different ways of thinking. One of his favorite mottoes was “Think for yourself and question authority.” The Game of Life is an organic computer, (although when Leary wrote it he wasn’t yet into hyper-interactive computer intelligence.) In this book he updated the meaning of Medieval Tarot Cards and Chinese I Ching Triagrams and used the symbology to express his fascinating theories within a multi-dimensional structure. With a unique intelligent wit, he expresses his perceptions, wisdom and ideas that evolution is proceeding into pre-programmed post-human stages which will carry us off the planet, but also that some human beings are (have always been) literally ahead of their times in having activated what Dr. Leary calls “circuits” of their nervous systems years or even centuries ahead of general human development. The Game of Life is not simply a book: it is an experience.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dr. Leary's first novel presents the Quixotic saga of Dylan. He has been assigned to a primitive planet in the latter years of the Roaring 20th Century to perform those small but precise jiggles needed to cause chaos in the old, outmoded gene-pools. Leary takes the reader across the planet in his pursuit of the answer to the seminal question: WHAT DOES WOMAN WANT?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fuga è la cronaca della rocambolesca evasione di Leary dalla prigione di San Luis Obipso in cui era stato rinchiuso nel 1970, accusato per due volte di possesso di marijuana. I Weatherman lo aiuteranno a lasciare l'America e ad arrivare in Algeria dove approderà, insieme a sua moglie Rosemary, nelle mani di Eldridge Cleaver, leader in esilio delle Pantere Nere. Varcato il muro del carcere iniziano le sue avventure: una corsa senza sosta verso la libertà.<br />Timothy Leary ora ha 75 anni. <br />E' stato ricercatore e guru, scrittore e organizzatore di grandi eventi collettivi. Leary, che non ha mai abbandonato la droga, è passato attraverso varie fasi di misticismo orientale e adesso è un predicatore del cyberspazio.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Writings that sparkle with the psychedelic revolution. The Politics of Ecstasy is Timothy Leary's most provocative and influential exploration of human consciousness, written during the period from his Harvard days to the Summer of Love. Includes his early pronouncements on the psychedelic movement and his views on social and political ramifications of psychedelic and mystical experience.<br />Here is the outspoken Playboy interview revealing the sexual power of LSD-a statement that many believe played a key role in provoking Leary's incarceration by the authorities; an early outline of the neurological theory that became Leary's classic eight-circuit model of the human nervous system; an insightful exploration of the life and work of novelist Hermann Hesse; an effervescent dialogue with humorist Paul Krassner; and an impassioned defense of what Leary called "The Fifth Freedom"-the right to get high.<br />]]></book_description>

Dance a mad dervish whirl of coincidence and synchronicity with Robert Anton Wilson and his dancing partners James Joyce, the Marquis de Sade, William S. Borroughs, Carl Jung, Timothy Leary, Bobbie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and a host of others.<br /><br />Coincidance is one of Wilson's personal favorites.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Before the <em>X-Files,</em> before alt.conspiracy, there was Robert Anton Wilson and his legendary <em>Illuminatus! Trilogy.</em> Now this avatar of conspiriology, renowned for his razor wit and progressive philosophy, takes you on a fascinating, eclectic ride through what Wilson has termed the "Cultic Twilight" where conspiracy theories flourish. <em>Everything Is Under Control</em> covers the range of Wilson's kaleidoscopic knowledge, from John Adams to the Voronezh (former Soviet Union) UFO sighting, the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu to the Mothman prophecies, and everything in between. What do the Freemasons, the Kennedys, and Princess Diana have in common? All are at the center of gigantic conspiracy theories with incredibly complex and endlessly multiplying twists, turns, highways and byways. Arranged by alphabetical entries which include cross-references to other entries in the book and also provide addresses to related sites on the Web, this book is truly interactive — you can dip in, read through, or follow one of the URLs from an interesting entry onto the internet.<br /><br />What some famous people say about Robert Anton Wilson:<br /><blockquote>"A dazzling barker hawking tickets to the most thrilling tilt-a-whirls and daring loop-o-planes on the midway to higher consciousness."<br />--Tom Robbins<br />"Wilson managed to reverse every mental polarity in me, as if I had been pulled through infinity."<br />—Philip K. Dick<br />"One of the most important scientific philosophers of his century — scholarly, witty, scientific, hip and hopeful."<br />—Dr. Timothy Leary</blockquote>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This, the long-awaited third volume of the Cosmic Trigger series, includes Wilson's witty and humorous observations about the widely spread (and, happily, premature) announcement of his demise. And, of course, what Wilson masterpiece would be complete without synchronicities, religious fanatics, UFOs, crop circles, paranoia, pompous scientists, secret societies, high tech, black magic, quantum physics, hoaxes (real and fake), Orson Welles, James Joyce, Carl Sagan, Madonna and The Vagina of Nuit.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[While this, the second volume of the Cosmic Trigger trilogy, continues along the path set by the original Cosmic Trigger I: Final Secret of the Illuminati, it also stands solidly on its own. Any reader with an open mind and a sense of humor cannot help but be entertained and enlightened while following Wilson's explorations into such subjects as the future of cyberspace; the peculiarities of Irish jurisprudence; links among the Mafia, the CIA and the Catholic Church; anal-eroticism in The White House; the Dog Castrator of Palm Springs; and many more observations from his infinitely fertile brain.]]></book_description>

Nonetheless, human thinking is still deeply rooted in the cosmology of the Middle Ages. <i>Quantum Psychology</i> is <i>the</i> book to change your way of perceiving yourself—and the universe—for the 21st century. Some say it's materialistic, others call it scientific and still others insist it's mystical. It is all of these—and none.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Cosmic Trigger" deals with a process of deliberately induced brain change... This is called "initiation" or "vision quest" in many traditional societies and ... a dangerous variety of self-psychotherapy in modern terminology. I do not recommend it for everybody... the main thing I learned is that "reality is always plural and mutable." <br />— From the Preface]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Take a quantum leap into the universe of Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy. It's a wise and wacky look at our recent past seen through a fun-house mirror...it's a satire on our violent, inexplicable, wonderful world...and it's a mind trip inward to expose our deepest hopes and fears.<br /><br />The missing plutonium a terrorist group turns into nuclear devices, the Mad Fishmonger, the future America called Unistat, our hero Benny "Eggs" Benedict, and the Invisible Hand are real but beyond the Black Hole, out of space, out of time—in the universe next door.]]></book_description>
