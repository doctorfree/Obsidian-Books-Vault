    <book_description><![CDATA[It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war—and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan.<br /><br />This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.]]></book_description>

But to find any kind of lead he has to pose as a user and, inevitably, without realising what is happening, Arctor is soon as addicted as the junkies he works among...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>VALIS</i> is the first book in Philip K. Dick's incomparable final trio of novels (the others being <i>The Divine Invasion</i> and <i>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</i>). This disorienting and bleakly funny work is about a schizophrenic hero named Horselover Fat; the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity; and reality as revealed through a pink laser. <i>VALIS</i> is a theological detective story, in which God is both a missing person and the perpetrator of the ultimate crime.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Jason Tavener woke up one morning to find himself completely unknown. The night before he had been the top-rated television star with millions of devoted watchers. The next day he was just an unidentified walking object, whose face nobody recognised, of whom no one had heard, and without the I.D. papers required in that near future.<br /><br />When he finally found a man who would agree to counterfeiting such cards for him, that man turned out to be a police informer. And then Taverner found out not only what it was like to be a nobody but also to be hunted by the whole apparatus of society.<br /><br />It was obvious that in some way Taverner had become the pea in in some sort of cosmic shell game - but how? And why?<br /><br />Philip K. Dick takes the reader on a walking tour of solipsism's scariest margin in his latest novel about the age we are already half into.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</i>, the final novel in the trilogy that also includes <i>Valis</i> and <i>The Divine Invasion</i>, is an anguished, learned, and very moving investigation of the paradoxes of belief. It is the story of Timothy Archer, an urbane Episcopal bishop haunted by the suicides of his son and mistress - and driven by them into a bizarre quest for the identity of Christ.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Philip K. Dick’s latest novel starts out on a lonely planet in the star system CY30-CY30B and ends up in Hollywood on a future Earth which is not quite ours. Along the way we encounter God, His Son, Elijah the Prophet, and the demon Belial, who controls Earth. Through the course of the book we have an opportunity to deal with the problems of Good versus Evil, reality and illusion, and how it feels to listen to canned music for ten years without being able to turn it off.<br /><br />Herb Asher, selfish and indifferent, lives alone in a dome on a planet where he operates a microwave relay transmitter/receiver and spends much of his time watching 3-D holo tapes of his favorite superstar singer, Linda Fox. One day a local deity interferes with his tapes and sends him on a reluctant mission of mercy to visit a dying woman in a nearby dome. They are joined by Elias, a wanderer, who turns out to be (literally) the Prophet Elijah and who explains to them that Rybys, the woman, is pregnant with the Son of God and that they must return to Earth as a married couple for the birth of the child to prepare for Armageddon, in which the powers of evil will be finally and completely defeated and Earth will be saved.<br /><br />Accidents ensue as they reach Earth and Rybys dies, Emmanuel is born brain-damaged and Herb spends ten years in cryonic suspension listening to Muzak. Emmanuel is put into a special school, where as a child He meets a girl named Zina, who is, in fact, a supernatural being. She reveals to Him His own suppressed knowledge of the purpose of His existence and her involvement in it. By the combination of their powers we are transported to a different world, an alternate version of Earth. Rybys is alive there and married to Herb, who runs a music store and is falling in love with an obscure singer named Linda Fox.<br /><br />There Herb is captured by Belial, who appears in the form of a baby goat, and in a powerful and moving scene Herb discovers his salvation, and Earth’s, in the strength of his love for Linda.<br /><br />In this book Philip K. Dick brings together many of his thematic concerns expressed over the years. With roots in the Torah and the Cabala and with a sense of deeply felt mystical vision, he combines an interplanetary setting and a gritty social realism to produce a book that challenges the normal definitions of science fiction and our notions of what science fiction is and is not supposed to be. He makes a compelling personal statement about belief, humanity, and life—and again tells an irresistible, fascinating, entirely unique and <i>real</i> story about people living humanly in a world which they cannot control but in which they ultimately triumph.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[On the arid colony of Mars the only thing more precious than water may be a ten-year-old schizophrenic boy named Manfred Steiner. For although the UN has slated 'anomalous' children for deportation and destruction, other people—especially Supreme Goodmember Arnie Kott of the Water Workers' union—suspect that Manfred's disorder may be a window into the future. <br /><br />But what sort of future? And what happens to those unfortunates whom Manfred ushers into it? In <i>Martian Time-Slip</i> Philip K. Dick uses power politics and extraterrestrial real estate scams, adultery, and murder to penetrate the mysteries of being and time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[How would you feel if solid objects began to dematerialize in front of your very eyes?<br /><br />When a soft-drinks stand does just that in front of Ragle Gumm he thinks he's having a nervous breakdown. He puts it down to stress. Every day Ragle sends in his entry to the competition in the Gazette. Every day he's a surefire winner. He's a local celebrity, a hero with a position in town to maintain. Despite having no job, Ragle is under pressure. Pressure to win.<br /><br />But as weird things continue to happen to him, Ragle's anxiety turns to paranoia. He thinks he's the centre of the universe, then that ‘They’ — whoever ‘They’ may be — are out to get him. As his desperation grows, he realizes that it's all very well being the centre of the Universe, but only if you know <i>which</i> Universe.<br /><br />Front cover illustration by Tom Stimpson<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the late 1960s a paranoid incompetent has schemed his way into the White House and convulsed America in a vicious war against imaginary internal enemies. A struggling science Fiction writer named Philip K. Dick is trying to keep from becoming one of that war's casualties. And Dick's best friend, a record executive named Nicholas Brady, is receiving transmissions from an extraterrestrial entity that may also happen to be God — an entity that apparently wants him to overthrow the President.<br /><br />In this, his last novel, Philip K. Dick morphed and recombined themes that had informed his fiction from <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> to <i>VALIS</i> and produced a wild, impassioned work that reads like a visionary alternate history of the United States. Agonizingly suspenseful, darkly hilarious, and filled with enough conspiracy theories to thrill the most hardened paranoid, <i>Radio Free Albemuth</i> is proof of Dick's stature as our century's greatest prankster-prophet.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Simulacra tells of a mid-21st century United States of Europe &amp; America formed by merger of Germany &amp; the USA. The President's an android. Government's a fraud. Superpowers include the French Empire, Chinese People's Republic &amp; Free Africa. Communism exists with Warsaw as its center. A WWIII involving tactical nuclear weapons is mentioned.<br /> There are two classes: Geheimnisträger (secret bearers) &amp; Befehlsträger (instruction implementers). Political &amp; media power are consolidated. Democrats &amp; Republicans merged as the Democrat-Republican Party. NBC, CBS &amp; ABC are the United Triadic Network. Power centers on a permanent 1st Lady, Nicole Thibodeaux, whose consorts are a series of presidents, die Alten. The current der Alte, Rudi Kalbfleisch, is an android. Tho she died decades ago, her role's been held by four actors, the latest being Kate Rupert. This is Geheimnis. Possession of the secret insures elite membership by Ges status.<br /> A secretive governing council controls the USEA. Karp &amp; Söhne Werke, Der Alte's manufacturers, hold some power. The next simulacra contract, for Dieter Hogbein, will go to Frauenzimmer Assoc. Karp &amp; Söhne is unhappy about this new arrangement. They threaten exposure of what's been a state secret for five decades. Nicole dislikes Kalbfleisch. Inbuilt obsolescence means he'll suffer a heart attack &amp; be replaced.<br /> Egon Superb, the last psychotherapist, struggles to practice in a world full of the maladjusted. He encounters difficulties because A. G. Chemie, the leading USEA psycho-pharmaceutical drug cartel, has engineered a psychotherapy prohibition under the MacPhearson Act. The USEA allows him to treat Richard Kongrosian, a pianist performing at the White House. Kongrosian refuses to see anyone as he delusionally thinks his body odor lethal. He exhibits telekinetic abilities. Thibodeaux wants to control his abilities, as do Wilder Pembroke, Nat'l Police head, &amp; members of the covert governance council.<br /> Bertold Goltz, alleged neofascist, seemingly trying to overturn the government, runs Sons of Job, a religious paramilitary organisation. He's actually head of the covert USEA governing council. Ian Duncan loves the 1st Lady, whom he's never met. A subplot includes Charles Strikerock, his brother &amp; a cutrate spacecraft sales firm, Loony Luke's, involved in Mars colonisation. Mars has insectoid life, sentiently empathic papoola, while Ganymede's inhabited by multicellular life.<br /> Nothing is as it seems.]]></book_description>
