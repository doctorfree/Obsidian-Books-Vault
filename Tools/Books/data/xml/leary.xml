    <book_description><![CDATA[This manual uses material from <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> for this preparation. The authors also make an important contribution to the interpretation of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead.</i> They show that it is concerned not with the dead, but with the living. The last section of the manual provides instructions for an actual psychedelic session, under adequate safeguards.<br /><br />The authors were engaged in a program of experiments with LSD and other psychedelic drugs at Harvard University until sensational national publicity unfairly concentrating on student interest in the drugs, led to the suspension of the experiments. Since then, the authors have continued their work without academic auspices.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Irreverent, thought-provoking and hilarious, Leary's parting shot pioneers new ways to die and new ways for the living to think about death. Urging us to take control of our deaths (and even to determine when and how we will die). Leary relates his own plan for "directed dying," a death we plan and orchestrate to reflect our own lives and values.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Timothy Leary, Ph.D.</i> has been a world-renowned psychologist, a defrocked Harvard professor, a relentless champion of brain change, a reputed drug guru, a stand-up philosopher, and a prisoner of the Nixon administration. He has been called 'the most dangerous man on the planet.'<br /><br />While in prison, at time in solitary confinement, he wrote the first version of this book. ("I must confess that at that time I was alienated, a bit daft and given to occasional fits of irritation. So color the first version of this book indigo—as in Jail House Blues.") Now revised and updated, <i>Neuropolitique</i> presents some of Dr. Leary's best ideas, his reflections on the past and his hope for the future.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Written in 70s with all the influence of the wild and counterculture rebelliousness of the 60s, The Game of Life reflects the depth of mind of one of the unique human beings of the 20th century. From famed psychologist and Harvard professor to LSD Guru, to stage and film star, computer junky, and more. Tim leaves no stone, or for that matter, person unturned. As an unrepentant advocate of personal freedom and development, he was on a mission to wake humanity up, to encourage us to use our brains and open our minds up to different ways of thinking. One of his favorite mottoes was “Think for yourself and question authority.” The Game of Life is an organic computer, (although when Leary wrote it he wasn’t yet into hyper-interactive computer intelligence.) In this book he updated the meaning of Medieval Tarot Cards and Chinese I Ching Triagrams and used the symbology to express his fascinating theories within a multi-dimensional structure. With a unique intelligent wit, he expresses his perceptions, wisdom and ideas that evolution is proceeding into pre-programmed post-human stages which will carry us off the planet, but also that some human beings are (have always been) literally ahead of their times in having activated what Dr. Leary calls “circuits” of their nervous systems years or even centuries ahead of general human development. The Game of Life is not simply a book: it is an experience.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dr. Leary's first novel presents the Quixotic saga of Dylan. He has been assigned to a primitive planet in the latter years of the Roaring 20th Century to perform those small but precise jiggles needed to cause chaos in the old, outmoded gene-pools. Leary takes the reader across the planet in his pursuit of the answer to the seminal question: WHAT DOES WOMAN WANT?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fuga è la cronaca della rocambolesca evasione di Leary dalla prigione di San Luis Obipso in cui era stato rinchiuso nel 1970, accusato per due volte di possesso di marijuana. I Weatherman lo aiuteranno a lasciare l'America e ad arrivare in Algeria dove approderà, insieme a sua moglie Rosemary, nelle mani di Eldridge Cleaver, leader in esilio delle Pantere Nere. Varcato il muro del carcere iniziano le sue avventure: una corsa senza sosta verso la libertà.<br />Timothy Leary ora ha 75 anni. <br />E' stato ricercatore e guru, scrittore e organizzatore di grandi eventi collettivi. Leary, che non ha mai abbandonato la droga, è passato attraverso varie fasi di misticismo orientale e adesso è un predicatore del cyberspazio.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Writings that sparkle with the psychedelic revolution. The Politics of Ecstasy is Timothy Leary's most provocative and influential exploration of human consciousness, written during the period from his Harvard days to the Summer of Love. Includes his early pronouncements on the psychedelic movement and his views on social and political ramifications of psychedelic and mystical experience.<br />Here is the outspoken Playboy interview revealing the sexual power of LSD-a statement that many believe played a key role in provoking Leary's incarceration by the authorities; an early outline of the neurological theory that became Leary's classic eight-circuit model of the human nervous system; an insightful exploration of the life and work of novelist Hermann Hesse; an effervescent dialogue with humorist Paul Krassner; and an impassioned defense of what Leary called "The Fifth Freedom"-the right to get high.<br />]]></book_description>
