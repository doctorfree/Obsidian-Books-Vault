    <book_description><![CDATA[Born in '80, Dr Jim Parsons undergoes abrupt involuntary time travel from 2012 to 2405 to find his profession treated disdainfully. Population is static, with no natural births. Only death allows an embryo's formation. The society's ambivalent about death. Eugenics ensures successive generations better benefit the species. By killing the weak, poverty &amp; disease are eliminated &amp; survival is optimized. A single race derived from African- &amp; Native Americans controls this world. Caucasians were wiped out or integrated centuries earlier.<br /> Parsons cures a woman, not knowing this is a crime. Chancellor Al Stenog exiles him to Mars. The spaceship is intercepted &amp; Parsons is returned to a deserted far future Earth. On finding a marker with instructions on operating the spaceship's time travel controls, he's directed to an Amerind tribal lodge, where he must perform surgery to save the life of a wounded time traveller, Corith, after the latter had died from an arrow wound. Parsons extracts it. It later mysteriously rematerializes in Corith's body.<br /> To resolve the situation, Parsons &amp; Corith's relatives travel back to Corith's previous assignment in 1579 on N. America's west coast, where Corith was to kill Francis Drake to alter history &amp; preserve Amerind lifeways against European subjugation. Observing the assassination attempt, Parsons realizes Drake is actually Stenog, lying in wait for Corith. Parsons tries warning Corith. Corith discovers Parsons is white &amp; attacks him. Struggling, Parsons inadvertently stabs Corith's heart with an arrow meant for Drake.<br /> In retribution, Parsons is left stranded by Corith's relatives in 1597, by which time the Europeans had departed. Parsons is rescued by Loris, Corith's daughter, when she learns she'll have Parson's child in the future. Briefly back in 2405, Parsons realizes the reason the arrow mysteriously reappeared in Corith's chest was because he'd murdered him for a 2nd time to cover his tracks. If Corith recovered, he'd have revealed it was Parsons who killed him &amp; an unwitting Parsons from slightly earlier would've been helpless at the hands Corith's relatives. As he stands over Corith, ready to kill him a 2nd time, he decides against it &amp; tries fleeing. Before doing so, two people appear in the room from the future &amp; kill Corith with the 2nd arrow. Parsons realizes the murderers are children he'd had with Loris, traveling back to 2405 from a more distant future.<br /> His children take Parsons forward in time to meet with Loris again. He struggles with the decision to return to 2012. Eventually he returns to the same day he'd left &amp; to the doting wife who saw him off that morning. He sets about his old life, a new task at hand. The novel ends with him placing the stone marker that'll save his life on a desolate future Earth.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Philip K. Dick said that his purpose as a writer was "to pierce through the veil of what is only apparently real and get to what is really real." Meditation upon the nature of reality leads one down strange pathways. Nothing is as it seems. This is a book about a man who experienced this, expressed it brilliantly, and refused to stop at that, devoting himself instead in his works to the passionate and often comical search for what is, if it isn't what it seems to be.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Anne Dick's book is part memoir, and part a kind of detective novel, as she sifts through the details of her life with Philip K Dick, a prolific genius whose books and novels are being recognized as significant works of literature. Much of Dick's work, currently being celebrated in college courses and prestigious anthologies like The Library of America, consists of a kind of surreal autobiography and Anne's memoir helps us connect his fictional characters to his life. Philip K Dick was quite a character himself, both on and off the page, and Anne's memoir bravely explores her tumultuous relationship with this mercurial man in an attempt to better understand him and his writing. A touching aspect of this memoir is that it represents Anne's search as well.<br /><br />Anne witnessed first-hand the most prolific period in Dick's career, a five year period year stretch from 1958 - 1964 during which time Philip wrote many of his most celebrated novels including: <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</i>, <i>Martian Time-Slip</i>, <i>Confessions of a Crap Artist</i>, <i>Dr Bloodmoney</i>, <i>We Can Build You</i>, <i>Now Wait For Last Year</i>, and <i>The Simulacra</i>. Anne, a fifty four year resident of Point Reyes Station, still lives in the modern Campbell and Wong house she shared with Philip, a house that was featured in many of Dick's books. Reading Anne's memoir will open up many of Philip's works, revealing the autobiographical material often buried deep in his texts. Biography lovers will enjoy the intensity of detail Anne brings to Dick's complex and intense struggles. Anne spent several years conducting interviews with Dick's friends, family, and colleagues, assembling perhaps the most thoroughly researched biography of Philip K Dick currently available. <br /><br />--- <br />Editor's description:<br /><br />Brilliant, talented, and charismatic, Philip K. Dick had it all. Already a successful young writer with a highly promising career, in 1958 he met his intellectual and romantic soulmate, his soon-to-be third wife Anne Rubenstein.<br /><br />To his new family and friends, Dick appeared cheerful and loving. But behind the facade of an untroubled life was a man struggling with inner demons. Slowly and always in denial, Anne watched his disconnect from reality and witnessed his increasing paranoia. Philip K. Dick had begun his descent into madness.<br /><br />In this riveting memoir and biography, Anne Dick creates an extraordinary portrait of one of the twentieth century's most important writers. Through this no-holds-barred account, she reveals the compelling genius and private hell of Philip K. Dick, for better and for worse.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Maybe this book is TMI but for a Phil Dick fanatic like myself it is juicy behind the scenes real life meets sci-fi meets am I insane or are those really CIA/FBI/Aliens following me. Dick's 3rd wife Anne tells every bit of her side of the story in this frank account of their years together in Point Reyes. She follows this up with a thoroughly researched accounting of PKD's descent into  after he left her and moved to the East Bay and later Southern California. The book likely enraged Dick fans around the world but it's a fascinating read. Not only because Philip K. Dick is one of the most fascinating people to have lived but also because Anne Dick manages to remind us what life was like for an American wife and woman in the Fifties and Sixties. Everything, including most people's neurotic behavior, was blamed on the mother. Heck, at one point the Point Reyes sheriff comes out to their house, talks calmly with Phil Dick, and trundles Anne off to a mental hospital for 72 hours observation! Those were the days. ]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Simulacra tells of a mid-21st century United States of Europe &amp; America formed by merger of Germany &amp; the USA. The President's an android. Government's a fraud. Superpowers include the French Empire, Chinese People's Republic &amp; Free Africa. Communism exists with Warsaw as its center. A WWIII involving tactical nuclear weapons is mentioned.<br /> There are two classes: Geheimnisträger (secret bearers) &amp; Befehlsträger (instruction implementers). Political &amp; media power are consolidated. Democrats &amp; Republicans merged as the Democrat-Republican Party. NBC, CBS &amp; ABC are the United Triadic Network. Power centers on a permanent 1st Lady, Nicole Thibodeaux, whose consorts are a series of presidents, die Alten. The current der Alte, Rudi Kalbfleisch, is an android. Tho she died decades ago, her role's been held by four actors, the latest being Kate Rupert. This is Geheimnis. Possession of the secret insures elite membership by Ges status.<br /> A secretive governing council controls the USEA. Karp &amp; Söhne Werke, Der Alte's manufacturers, hold some power. The next simulacra contract, for Dieter Hogbein, will go to Frauenzimmer Assoc. Karp &amp; Söhne is unhappy about this new arrangement. They threaten exposure of what's been a state secret for five decades. Nicole dislikes Kalbfleisch. Inbuilt obsolescence means he'll suffer a heart attack &amp; be replaced.<br /> Egon Superb, the last psychotherapist, struggles to practice in a world full of the maladjusted. He encounters difficulties because A. G. Chemie, the leading USEA psycho-pharmaceutical drug cartel, has engineered a psychotherapy prohibition under the MacPhearson Act. The USEA allows him to treat Richard Kongrosian, a pianist performing at the White House. Kongrosian refuses to see anyone as he delusionally thinks his body odor lethal. He exhibits telekinetic abilities. Thibodeaux wants to control his abilities, as do Wilder Pembroke, Nat'l Police head, &amp; members of the covert governance council.<br /> Bertold Goltz, alleged neofascist, seemingly trying to overturn the government, runs Sons of Job, a religious paramilitary organisation. He's actually head of the covert USEA governing council. Ian Duncan loves the 1st Lady, whom he's never met. A subplot includes Charles Strikerock, his brother &amp; a cutrate spacecraft sales firm, Loony Luke's, involved in Mars colonisation. Mars has insectoid life, sentiently empathic papoola, while Ganymede's inhabited by multicellular life.<br /> Nothing is as it seems.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Objective, unbiased and hyper-rational, the Vulcan 3 should have been the perfect ruler. The omnipotent computer dictates policy that is in the best interests of all citizens — or at least, that is the idea. But when the machine, whose rule evolved out of chaos and war, begins to lose control of the “Healer” movement of religious fanatics and the mysterious force behind their rebellion, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the master chronicler of psychological extremes, an unforgettable portrait of the “Shakespeare of science fiction” whose work has influenced millions</b><br /><br />For his many devoted readers, Philip K. Dick is not only one of the “most valiant psychological explorers of the 20th century” (<i>The New York Times</i>) but a source of divine revelation. Dick, whose work inspired such films as <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Total Recall</i>, and <i>Minority Report</i>, dedicated his life to solving one ultimately unanswerable question: What is real?<br /><br />In the riveting style that won accolades for <i>The Adversary</i>, Emmanuel Carrère follows Dick’s strange odyssey from his traumatic beginnings in 1928, when his twin sister died in infancy, to his lonely end in 1982, beset by mystical visions of swirling pink lights, three-eyed invaders, and messages from the Roman Empire. Drawing on interviews as well as unpublished sources, Carrère traces Dick’s multiple marriages, paranoid fantasies, and vertiginous encounters with the drug culture of sixties California. He vividly conjures the spirit of this restless observer of American postwar malaise, whose more than fifty novels subverted the materials of science fiction—parallel universes, intricate time loops, collective delusions—to create classic works of contemporary anxiety.<br /><br />As disturbing and engrossing as a book by its subject, Carrère’s unconventional work interweaves life and art to reveal the maddening genius whose writing foresaw—from cloning to reality TV—a world that looks ever more like one of his inventions. <br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For all the strange worlds borne of his vast and vivid imagination, Philip K. Dick was largely concerned with humanity’s most achingly familiar heartaches and struggles. In <b>Our Friends From Frolix 8</b>, he clashes private dreams against public battles in a fast-paced and provocative tale that ultimately addresses our salvation both as individuals and a whole.<br /><br />Nick Appleton is a menial laborer whose life is a series of endless frustrations. Willis Gram is the despotic oligarch of a planet ruled by big-brained elites. When they both fall in love with Charlotte Boyer, a feisty black marketer of revolutionary propaganda, Nick seems destined for doom. But everything takes a decidedly unpredictable turn when the revolution’s leader, Thors Provoni, returns from ten years of intergalactic hiding with a ninety-ton protoplasmic slime that is bent on creating a new world order. <br /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Yielding to a compulsion he can't explain, Ted Barton interrupts his vacation in order to visit the town of his birth, Millgate, Virginia. But upon entering the sleepy, isolated little hamlet, Ted is distraught to find that the place bears no resemblance to the one he left behind--and never did. He also discovers that in this Millgate Ted Barton died of scarlet fever when he was nine years old. Perhaps even more troubling is the fact that it is literally impossible to escape. Unable to leave, Ted struggles to find the reason for such disturbing incongruities, but before long, he finds himself in the midst of a struggle between good and evil that stretches far beyond the confines of the valley.<br /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino.

Jim Briskin, campaigning to be the first black president of the United States, thinks alter-Earth is the solution to the chronic overpopulation that has seventy million people cryogenically frozen; Tito Cravelli, a shadowy private detective, wants to know why Dr Lurton Sands is hiding his mistress on the planet; billionaire mutant George Walt wants to make the empty world all his own. But when the other earth turns out to be inhabited, everything changes.<br /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Scalding sarcastic yet enduringly empathetic, "The Zap Gun"is Dick's remarkable novel depicting the insanity of the arms race. Lars Powderdry and Lilo Topchev are counterpart weapons fashion designers for a world divided into two factions - Wes-bloc and Peep-East. Since the Plowshare Protocols of 2002, their job has been to invent elaborate weapons that only seem massively lethal. But when alien satellites hostile to both sides appear in the sky, the two are brought together in the dire hope that they can create a weapon to save the world, a task made all the more difficult by Lars falling in love with Lilo even as he knows she's trying to kill him.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Floyd Jones is sullen, ungainly, and quite possibly mad, but in a very short time he will rise from telling fortunes at a mutant carnival to convulsing an entire planet. For although Jones has the power to see the future — a power that makes his life a torment — his real gift lies elsewhere: in his ability to make people dream again in a world where dreaming has been made illegal, even when the dream is indistinguishable from a nightmare.<br /><br />In Philip K. Dick's unsettling chronicle of the rise and fall of a postnuclear messiah, readers will find a novel that is as minutely realistic as it is prophetic. For along with its engineered mutants, hermaphroditic sex performers, and protoplasmic drifters from the stars, <i>The World Jones Made</i> gives us nothing less than a deadly accurate reading of our own hunger for belief.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The operating principle was random selection: positions of public power were decided by a sophisticated lottery and when the magnetic lottery bottle twitched, anyone could become the absolute ruler of the world, the Quizmaster.<br /><br />But with the power came the game – the assassination game – which everyone could watch on TV. Would the new man be good enough to evade his chosen killer? Which made for fascinating and exciting viewing, compelling enough to distract the public’s attention while the Big Five industrial complexes ran the world. Then, in 2203, with the choice of a member of a maverick cult as Quizmaster, the system developed a little hitch…<br /><br /><i>Solar Lottery</i> was Philip K. Dick’s first published novel, brilliant and idiosyncratic, powerful and affecting.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A masterwork by Philip K. Dick, this is the final, expanded version of the novella <i>The Unteleported Man</i>, which Dick worked on shortly before his death. In <i>Lies, Inc.</i>, fans of the science fiction legend will immediately recognize his hallmark themes of life in a security state, conspiracy, and the blurring of reality and illusion. This publication marks its first complete appearance in the United States.<br /><br />In this wry, paranoid vision of the future, overpopulation has turned cities into cramed industrial anthills. For those sick of this dystopian reality, one corporation, Trails of Hoffman, Inc., promises an alternative: Take a teleport to Whale's Mouth, a colonized planet billed as the supreme paradise. The only catch is that you can never comeback. When a neurotic man named Rachmael ben Applebaum discovers that the promotional films of happy crowds cheering their newfound existence on Whale's Mouth are faked, he decides to pilot a scapeship on the eighteen-year journey there to see if anyone wants to return.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this sardonically funny gem of speculative fiction, Philip K. Dick creates a novel that manages to be simultaneously unpredictable and perversely logical. Poor Pete Garden has just lost Berkeley. He's also lost his wife, but he'll get a new one as soon as he rolls a three. It's all part of the rules of Bluff, the game that's become a blinding obsession for the last inhabitants of the planet Earth. But the rules are about to change--drastically and terminally--because Pete Garden will be playing his next game against an opponent who isn't even human, for stakes that are a lot higher than Berkeley.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fourteen strangers come to Delmak-O. Thirteen of them were transferred by the usual authorities. One got there by praying. But once they arrived on that treacherous planet, whose very atmosphere seemed to induce paranoia and psychosis, the newcomers tound that even prayer was useless. For on Delmak-O, God is either absent or intent on destroying His creations. At once a wrenching metaphysical thriller and an ingenious meditation on the nature of divinity, <i>A Maze of Death</i> is Philip K. Dick at his most dizzyingly provocative.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dr. Eric Sweetscent has problems. His planet is enmeshed in an unwinnable war. His wife is lethally addicted to a drug that whips its users helplessly back and forth across time -- and is hell-bent on making Eric suffer along with her. And Sweetscent's newest patient is not only the most important man on the embattled planet Earth but quite possibly the sickest. For Secretary Gino Molinari has turned his mortal illness into an instrument of political policy -- and Eric cannot tell if his job is to make the man better or to keep him poised just this side of death.<br /><br />Now Wait for Last Year bursts through the envelope between the impossible and the inevitable. Even as it ushers us into a future that looks uncannily like the present, it makes the normal seem terrifyingly provisional -- and compels anyone who reads it to wonder if he really knows what time it is.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Glimmung wants Joe Fernwright. Fernwright is a pot-healer - a repairer of ceramics - in a drably utilitarian future where such skills have little value. And the Glimmung? The Glimmung is a being that looks something like a gyroscope, something like a teenaged girl, and something like the contents of an ocean. What's more, it may be divine. And, like certain gods of old Earth, it has a bad temper.<br /><br />What could an omnipresent and seemingly omnipotent entity want with a humble pot-healer? Or with the dozens of other odd creatures it has lured to Plowman's Planet? And if the Glimmung is a god, are its ends positive or malign? Combining quixotic adventure, spine-chilling horror, and deliriously paranoid theology, <i>Galactic Pot-Healer</i> is a uniquely Dickian voyage to alternate worlds of the imagination.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

For fifteen years, subterranean humanity has been fed on daily broadcasts of a never-ending nuclear destruction, sustained by a belief in the all powerful Protector. But up on Earth's surface, a different kind of reality reigns. East and West are at peace. Across the planet, an elite corps of expert hoaxers preserve the lie.<br /><br />Cover Illustration: Chris Moore]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Louis Rosen and his partners sell people--ingeniously designed, historically authentic simulacra of personages such as Edwin M. Stanton and Abraham Lincoln. The problem is that the only prospective buyer is a rapacious billionaire whose plans for the simulacra could land Louis in jail. Then there's the added complication that someone--or something--like Abraham Lincoln may not want to be sold.<br /><br />Is an electronic Lincoln any less alive than his creators? Is a machine that cares and suffers inferior to the woman Louis loves--a borderline psychopath who does neither? With irresistible momentum, intelligence, and wit, Philip K. Dick creates an arresting techno-thriller that suggests a marriage of <i>Bladerunner</i> and <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Confessions of a Crap Artist is one of Philip K. Dick's weirdest and most accomplished novels. Jack Isidore is a crap artist -- a collector of crackpot ideas (among other things, he believes that the earth is hollow and that sunlight has weight) and worthless objects, a man so grossly unequipped for real life that his sister and brother-in-law feel compelled to rescue him from it. But seen through Jack's murderously innocent gaze, Charlie and Juddy Hume prove to be just as sealed off from reality, in thrall to obsessions that are slightly more acceptable than Jack's, but a great deal uglier.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the late 1960s a paranoid incompetent has schemed his way into the White House and convulsed America in a vicious war against imaginary internal enemies. A struggling science Fiction writer named Philip K. Dick is trying to keep from becoming one of that war's casualties. And Dick's best friend, a record executive named Nicholas Brady, is receiving transmissions from an extraterrestrial entity that may also happen to be God — an entity that apparently wants him to overthrow the President.<br /><br />In this, his last novel, Philip K. Dick morphed and recombined themes that had informed his fiction from <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> to <i>VALIS</i> and produced a wild, impassioned work that reads like a visionary alternate history of the United States. Agonizingly suspenseful, darkly hilarious, and filled with enough conspiracy theories to thrill the most hardened paranoid, <i>Radio Free Albemuth</i> is proof of Dick's stature as our century's greatest prankster-prophet.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[How would you feel if solid objects began to dematerialize in front of your very eyes?<br /><br />When a soft-drinks stand does just that in front of Ragle Gumm he thinks he's having a nervous breakdown. He puts it down to stress. Every day Ragle sends in his entry to the competition in the Gazette. Every day he's a surefire winner. He's a local celebrity, a hero with a position in town to maintain. Despite having no job, Ragle is under pressure. Pressure to win.<br /><br />But as weird things continue to happen to him, Ragle's anxiety turns to paranoia. He thinks he's the centre of the universe, then that ‘They’ — whoever ‘They’ may be — are out to get him. As his desperation grows, he realizes that it's all very well being the centre of the Universe, but only if you know <i>which</i> Universe.<br /><br />Front cover illustration by Tom Stimpson<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[On the arid colony of Mars the only thing more precious than water may be a ten-year-old schizophrenic boy named Manfred Steiner. For although the UN has slated 'anomalous' children for deportation and destruction, other people—especially Supreme Goodmember Arnie Kott of the Water Workers' union—suspect that Manfred's disorder may be a window into the future. <br /><br />But what sort of future? And what happens to those unfortunates whom Manfred ushers into it? In <i>Martian Time-Slip</i> Philip K. Dick uses power politics and extraterrestrial real estate scams, adultery, and murder to penetrate the mysteries of being and time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Philip K. Dick’s latest novel starts out on a lonely planet in the star system CY30-CY30B and ends up in Hollywood on a future Earth which is not quite ours. Along the way we encounter God, His Son, Elijah the Prophet, and the demon Belial, who controls Earth. Through the course of the book we have an opportunity to deal with the problems of Good versus Evil, reality and illusion, and how it feels to listen to canned music for ten years without being able to turn it off.<br /><br />Herb Asher, selfish and indifferent, lives alone in a dome on a planet where he operates a microwave relay transmitter/receiver and spends much of his time watching 3-D holo tapes of his favorite superstar singer, Linda Fox. One day a local deity interferes with his tapes and sends him on a reluctant mission of mercy to visit a dying woman in a nearby dome. They are joined by Elias, a wanderer, who turns out to be (literally) the Prophet Elijah and who explains to them that Rybys, the woman, is pregnant with the Son of God and that they must return to Earth as a married couple for the birth of the child to prepare for Armageddon, in which the powers of evil will be finally and completely defeated and Earth will be saved.<br /><br />Accidents ensue as they reach Earth and Rybys dies, Emmanuel is born brain-damaged and Herb spends ten years in cryonic suspension listening to Muzak. Emmanuel is put into a special school, where as a child He meets a girl named Zina, who is, in fact, a supernatural being. She reveals to Him His own suppressed knowledge of the purpose of His existence and her involvement in it. By the combination of their powers we are transported to a different world, an alternate version of Earth. Rybys is alive there and married to Herb, who runs a music store and is falling in love with an obscure singer named Linda Fox.<br /><br />There Herb is captured by Belial, who appears in the form of a baby goat, and in a powerful and moving scene Herb discovers his salvation, and Earth’s, in the strength of his love for Linda.<br /><br />In this book Philip K. Dick brings together many of his thematic concerns expressed over the years. With roots in the Torah and the Cabala and with a sense of deeply felt mystical vision, he combines an interplanetary setting and a gritty social realism to produce a book that challenges the normal definitions of science fiction and our notions of what science fiction is and is not supposed to be. He makes a compelling personal statement about belief, humanity, and life—and again tells an irresistible, fascinating, entirely unique and <i>real</i> story about people living humanly in a world which they cannot control but in which they ultimately triumph.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Jason Tavener woke up one morning to find himself completely unknown. The night before he had been the top-rated television star with millions of devoted watchers. The next day he was just an unidentified walking object, whose face nobody recognised, of whom no one had heard, and without the I.D. papers required in that near future.<br /><br />When he finally found a man who would agree to counterfeiting such cards for him, that man turned out to be a police informer. And then Taverner found out not only what it was like to be a nobody but also to be hunted by the whole apparatus of society.<br /><br />It was obvious that in some way Taverner had become the pea in in some sort of cosmic shell game - but how? And why?<br /><br />Philip K. Dick takes the reader on a walking tour of solipsism's scariest margin in his latest novel about the age we are already half into.]]></book_description>
