    <book_description><![CDATA[In her short lifetime, Flannery O'Connor became one of the most distinctive American writers of the twentieth century. By birth a native of Georgia and a Roman Catholic, O'Connor depicts, in all its comic and horrendous incongruity, the limits of worldly wisdom and the mysteries of divine grace in the "Christ-haunted" Protestant South. This <em>Library of America</em> collection, the most comprehensive ever published, contains all of her novels and short-story collections, as well as nine other stories, eight of her most important essays, and a selection of 259 witty, spirited, and revealing letters, twenty-one published here for the first time.<br /><br />Her fiction brilliantly explores the human obsession with seemingly banal things. It might be a new hat or clean hogs or, for Hazel Motes, hero of <i>Wise Blood</i> (1952), an automobile. "Nobody with a good car needs to be justified," Hazel assures himself while using its hood for a pulpit to preach his "Church Without Christ." As in O'Connor's subsequent work, the characters in this novel are driven to violence, even murder, and their strong vernacular endows them with the discomforting reality of next-door neighbors. "In order to recognize a freak," she remarks in one of her essays, "you have to have a conception of the whole man."<br /><br />In the title story of her first, dazzling collection of stories, <i>A Good Man Is Hard to Find</i> (1955), the old grandmother discovers the comic irrelevance of good manners when she and her family meet up with the sinister Misfit, who claims there is "no pleasure but meanness." The terror of urban dislocation in "The Artificial Nigger," the bizarre baptism in "The River," or one-legged Hulga Hopewell's encounter with a Bible salesman in "Good Country People"--these startling events give readers the uneasy sense of mysteries about to be revealed.<br /><br />Her second novel, <i>The Violent Bear It Away</i> (1960), casts the shadow of the Old Testament across a landscape of backwoods shacks, modern towns, and empty highways. Caught between the prophetic fury of his great-uncle and the unrelenting rationalism of his uncle, fourteen-year-old Francis Tarwater undergoes a terrifying trial of faith when he is commanded to baptize his idiot cousin.<br /><br />The nine stories in <i>Everything That Rises Must Converge</i> (1965) show O'Connor's powers at their height. The title story is a terrifying, heart-rending drama of familial and racial misunderstanding. "Revelation" and "The Enduring Chill" probe further into conflicts between parental figures and recalcitrant offspring, where as much tension is generated from quiet conversation as from the physical violence of gangsters and fanatics.]]></book_description>

Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami’s characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Stories you'll never forget—just try—from literature's favorite transgressive author <br /><br />Representing work that spans several years, Make Something Up is a compilation of 21 stories and one novella (some previously published, some not) that will disturb and delight. The absurdity of both life and death are on full display; in "Zombies," the best and brightest of a high school prep school become tragically addicted to the latest drug craze: electric shocks from cardiac defibrillators. In "Knock, Knock," a son hopes to tell one last off-color joke to a father in his final moments, while in "Tunnel of Love," a massage therapist runs the curious practice of providing 'relief' to dying clients. And in "Expedition," fans will be thrilled to find to see a side of Tyler Durden never seen before in a precursor story to Fight Club.<br /><br />Funny, caustic, bizarre, poignant; these stories represent everything readers have come to love and expect from Chuck Palahniuk. They have all the impact of a sharp blow to the solar plexus, with considerable collateral damage to the funny bone.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This has no isbn number. The back page has what appears to be a Chinese inscription including the numerals "59". The preface, written by Hemingway in 1938, indicates the stories were written between 1921 and 1938. A search reveals this is likely a bootleg copy of the 1st edition hardcover published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1953.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A new collection of stories by one of America’s most beloved and admired short-story writers, her first in fifteen years, since Birds of America (“Fluid, cracked, mordant, colloquial . . . Will stand by itself as one of our funniest, most telling anatomies of human love and vulnerability.” —The New York Times Book Review, cover).<br />These eight masterly stories reveal Lorrie Moore at her most mature and in a perfect configuration of craft, mind, and bewitched spirit, as she explores the passage of time and summons up its inevitable sorrows and hilarious pitfalls to reveal her own exquisite, singular wisdom.<br /><br />In “Debarking,” a newly divorced man tries to keep his wits about him as the United States prepares to invade Iraq, and against this ominous moment, we see—in all its irresistible wit and darkness—the perils of divorce and what can follow in its wake . . .<br /><br />In “Foes,” a political argument goes grotesquely awry as the events of 9/11 unexpectedly manifest themselves at a fund-raising dinner in Georgetown . . . In “The Juniper Tree,” a teacher visited by the ghost of her recently deceased friend is forced to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in a kind of nightmare reunion . . . And in “Wings,” we watch the inevitable unraveling of two once-hopeful musicians, neither of whom held fast to their dreams nor struck out along other paths, as Moore deftly depicts the intricacies of dead-ends-ville and the workings of regret . . .<br /><br />Here are people beset, burdened, buoyed; protected by raising teenage children; dating after divorce; facing the serious illness of a longtime friend; setting forth on a romantic assignation abroad, having it interrupted mid-trip, and coming to understand the larger ramifications and the impossibility of the connection . . . stories that show people coping with large dislocation in their lives, with risking a new path to answer the desire to be in relation—to someone . . .<br /><br />Gimlet-eyed social observation, the public and private absurdities of American life, dramatic irony, and enduring half-cracked love wend their way through each of these narratives in a heartrending mash-up of the tragic and the laugh-out-loud—the hallmark of life in Lorrie-Moore-land.<br />--jacket]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the original cover edition of <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25630779.ISBN__0374515360" title="ISBN:&#9;0374515360" rel="nofollow noopener">ISBN:	0374515360</a> (ISBN13: 9780374515362</b><br /><br /><b>Winner of the National Book Award</b><br /><br />The publication of this extraordinary volume firmly established Flannery O'Connor's monumental contribution to American fiction. There are thirty-one stories here in all, including twelve that do not appear in the only two story collections O'Connor put together in her short lifetime - <i>Everything That Rises Must Converge </i>and <i>A Good Man Is Hard to Find</i>. <br /><br />O'Connor published her first story, "The Geranium," in 1946, while she was working on her master's degree at the University of Iowa. Arranged chronologically, this collection shows that her last story, "Judgement Day" - sent to her publisher shortly before her death - is a brilliantly rewritten and transfigured version of "The Geranium." Taken together, these stories reveal a lively, penetrating talent that has given us some of the most powerful and disturbing fiction of the twentieth century. Also included is an introduction by O'Connor's longtime editor and friend, Robert Giroux.<br /><br />Contents:<br />The geranium -- <br />The barber -- <br />Wildcat -- <br />The crop -- <br />The turkey -- <br />The train -- <br />The peeler -- <br />The heart of the park -- <br />A stoke of good fortune -- <br />Enoch and the gorilla -- <br />A good man is hard to find -- <br />A late encounter with the enemy -- <br />The life you save may be your own -- <br />The river -- <br />A circle in the fire -- <br />The displaced person -- <br />A temple of the Holy Ghost -- <br />The artificial nigger -- <br />Good country people -- <br />You can't be any poorer than dead -- <br />Greenleaf -- <br />A view of the woods -- <br />The enduring chill -- <br />The comforts of home -- <br />Everything that rises must converge -- <br />The partridge festival -- <br />The lame shall enter first -- <br />Why do the heathen rage? -- <br />Revelation -- <br />Parker's back -- <br />Judgement Day.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This short-story collection <i>Welcome to the Monkey House</i> (1968) incorporates almost completely Vonnegut's 1961 "Canary in a Cathouse", which appeared within a few months of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> and capitalized upon that breakthrough novel and the enormous attention it suddenly brought.<br /><br />Drawn from both specialized science fiction magazines and the big-circulation general magazines which Vonnegut had been one of the few science writers to sell, the collection includes some of his most accomplished work from 1950 to 1968. The title story may be his most famous—a diabolical government asserts control through compulsory technology removing orgasm from sex—but Vonnegut's bitterness and wit, not in his earlier work as poisonous or unshielded as it later became, is well demonstrated.<br /><br />Two early stories from Galaxy science fiction magazine and one from Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (the famous "Harrison Bergeron") show Vonnegut's careful command of a genre about which he was always ambivalent, stories like "More Stately Mansions" or "The Foster Portfolio" the confines and formula of a popular fiction of which he was always suspicious. Vonnegut's affection for humanity and bewilderment as its corruption are manifest in these early works.<br /><br />Several of these stories (those which appeared in Collier's) were commissioned by Vonnegut's Cornell classmate and great supporter Knox Burger, also born in 1922.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Where I Live / Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (variant of You've Never Been to Barnstable?)<br />Harrison Bergeron / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Who Am I This Time? / Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (variant of My Name Is Everyone)<br />Welcome to the Monkey House / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Long Walk to Forever / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Foster Portfolio / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Miss Temptation / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />All the King's Horses / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Tom Edison's Shaggy Dog / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />New Dictionary / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Next Door / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />More Stately Mansions / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Hyannis Port Story / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />D.P. / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Report on the Barnhouse Effect / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Euphio Question / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Go Back to Your Precious Wife and Son / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Deer in the Works / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Lie / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />Unready to Wear / Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br />The Kid Nobody Could Handle (George M.

    <book_description><![CDATA[In David Sedaris’s world, no one is safe and no cow is sacred. A manic cross between Mark Leyner, Fran Lebowitz, and the <i>National Enquirer</i>, Sedaris’s collection of essays is a rollicking tour through the national Zeitgeist: a do-it-yourself suburban dad saves money by performing home surgery; a man who is loved too much flees the heavyweight champion of the world; a teenage suicide tries to incite a lynch mob at her funeral; a bitter Santa abuses the elves.<br /><br />David Sedaris made his debut on NPR’s <i>Morning Edition</i> with “SantaLand Diaries”, recounting his strange-but-true experiences as an elf at Macy’s, and soon became one of the show’s most popular commentators. With a perfect eye and a voice infused with as much empathy as wit, Sedaris writes stories and essays that target the soulful ridiculousness of our behavior. <i>Barrel Fever</i> is like a blind date with modern life, and anything can happen.<br /><br />Parade --<br />Music for lovers --<br />The last you'll hear from me --<br />My manuscript --<br />Firestone --<br />We get along --<br />Glen's homophobia newsletter vol. 3, no. 2 --<br />Don's story --<br />Season's greeting to our friends and family!!! --<br />Jamboree --<br />After Malison --<br />Barrel fever --<br />Diary of a smoker --<br />Giantess --<br />The curly kind --<br />SantaLand diaries]]></book_description>

From the shining notorious East Side, <i>When You Are Engulfed in Flames</i> confirms once again that David Sedaris is a master of mystery and suspense.<br /><br />Or how about...<br /><br />when set on fire, most of us either fumble for our wallets or waste valuable time feeling sorry for ourselves. David Sedaris has studied this phenomenon, and his resulting insights may very well save your life. Author of the national bestsellers <i>Should You Be Attacked By Snakes</i> and <i>If You Are Surrounded by Mean Ghosts</i>, David Sedaris, with <i>When You Are Engulfed in Flames</i>, is clearly at the top of his game.<br /><br />Oh, all right...<br /><br />David Sedaris has written yet another book of essays (his sixth). Subjects include a parasitic worm that once lived in his mother-in-law's leg, an encounter with a dingo, and the recreational use of an external catheter. Also recounted is the buying of a human skeleton and the author's attempt to quit smoking In Tokyo.<br /><br />Master of nothing, at the dead center of his game, Sedaris proves that when you play with matches, you sometimes light the whole pack on fire.<br />(front flap)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[David Sedaris's beloved holiday collection is new again with six more pieces, including a never before published story. Along with such favorites as the diaries of a Macy's elf and the annals of two very competitive families, are Sedaris's tales of tardy trick-or-treaters (<i>Us and Them</i>); the difficulties of explaining the Easter Bunny to the French (<i>Jesus Shaves</i>); what to do when you've been locked out in a snowstorm (<i>Let It Snow</i>); the puzzling Christmas traditions of other nations (<i>Six to Eight Black Men</i>); what Halloween at the medical examiner's looks like (<i>The Monster Mash</i>); and a barnyard secret Santa scheme gone awry (<i>Cow and Turkey</i>).]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Welcome to the hilarious, strange, elegiac, outrageous world of David Sedaris. In <i>Naked</i>, Sedaris turns the mania for memoir on its proverbial ear, mining the exceedingly rich terrain of his life, his family, and his unique worldview—a sensibility at once take-no-prisoners sharp and deeply charitable. A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice, without doubt one of the freshest in American writing.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Me Talk Pretty One Day" is a collection of essays about the everyday life of the author, David Sedaris. In it, he sheds light on the little details of everyday life, highlighting strange encounters he has had in a number of different contexts. Accordingly, there are too many small interactions laid out in the book to mention here. What’s important to grasp, though, is that Sedaris is interested in exposing not only the absurdities that people overlook in daily life, but also the humor that can be found in even the most mundane situations.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Selected and with an Introduction by Theodore Ziolkowski.<br /><br />In the spring of 1922, several months after completing <i>Siddhartha</i>, Hermann Hesse wrote a fairy tale that was also a love story, inspired by the woman who was to become his second wife. That story, <i>Pictor's Metamorphoses</i>, is presented here along with a half century of Hesse's other short writings. Inspired by the Arabian Nights and the tales of the Brothers Grimm, these nineteen stories display the full range of Hesse's lifetime fascination with fantasy--as dream, fairy tale, folktale, satire, and allegory.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[To read Hermann Hesse's fairy tales is to enter a fabulous world of dreams and visions, philosophy and passion. This landmark collection contains twenty-two of Hesse's finest stories in this genre, most translated into English here for the first time. Full of visionaries and seekers, princesses and wandering poets, his fairy tales speak to the place in our psyche that inspires us with deep spiritual longing; that compels us to leave home, and inevitably to return; and that harbors the greatest joys and most devastating wounds of our heart. <br /><br />Containing all the themes common in Hesse's great novels <i>Siddhartha</i>, <i>Steppenwolf</i>, and <i>Demian</i>—and mirroring events in his own life, these exquisite short pieces exhibit the same mystical and romantic impulses that contribute to the haunting brilliance of his major works. Several stories, including "The Poet," "The Fairy Tale About the Wicker Chair," and "The Painter," examine the dilemma of the artist, torn between the drive for perfection and the temptations of pleasure and social success. Other tales reflect changes and struggles within society: in "Faldum," a city is irrevocably transformed when each resident is granted his or her fondest wish; in "Strange News from Another Planet," "If the War Continues," and "The European," nightmarish landscapes convey Hesse's devastating critiques of nationalism, barbarism, and war.<br /> <br />Illuminating and inspiring, <i>The Fairy Tales of Hermann Hesse</i> will challenge and enchant readers of all ages. A distinguished and historic publication, this fine translation by Jack Zipes captures their subtlety and elegance for decades nto come.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A long-awaited collection of stories--twelve in all--by one of the most exciting writers at work today, the acclaimed author of <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> and <i>Self-Help.</i> Stories remarkable in their range, emotional force, and dark laughter, and in the sheer beauty and power of their language.<br /><br />From the opening story, "Willing", about a second-rate movie actress in her thirties who has moved back to Chicago, where she makes a seedy motel room her home and becomes involved with a mechanic who has not the least idea of who she is as a human being, <i>Birds of America</i> unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the unhinged, the lost, the unsettled of our America. <br /><br />In the story "Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People" ("There is nothing as complex in the world--no flower or stone--as a single hello from a human being"), a woman newly separated from her husband is on a long-planned trip through Ireland with her mother. When they set out on an expedition to kiss the Blarney Stone, the image of wisdom and success that her mother has always put forth slips away to reveal the panicky woman she really is. <br /><br />In "Charades," a family game at Christmas is transformed into a hilarious and insightful (and fundamentally upsetting) revelation of crumbling family ties. <br /><br />In "Community Life,"a shy, almost reclusive, librarian, Transylvania-born and Vermont-bred, moves in with her boyfriend, the local anarchist in a small university town, and all hell breaks loose. And in "Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens," a woman who goes through the stages of grief as she mourns the death of her cat (Anger, Denial, Bargaining, Haagen Dazs, Rage) is seen by her friends as really mourning other issues: the impending death of her parents, the son she never had, Bosnia.<br /><br />In what may be her most stunning book yet, Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal, the idiosyncratic and the mundane, with all the wit, brio, and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.<br /><br />Willing --<br />Which is more than I can say about some people --<br />Dance in America --<br />Community life --<br />Agnes of Iowa --<br />Charades --<br />Four calling birds, three French hens --<br />Beautiful grade --<br />What you want to do fine --<br />Real estate --<br />People like that are the only people here --<br />Terrific mother]]></book_description>

This volume includes all of the writer's earliest short and medium-length fiction (including some previously unpublished stories) covering the years 1952-1955.</p><p>

    <book_description><![CDATA[On the eve of his departure from Eugene, Oregon, to San Francisco and worldly success, a twenty-one-year-old unpublished writer named Richard Brautigan gave these funny, buoyant stories and poems as a gift to Edna Webster, the beloved mother of both his best friend and his first "real" girlfriend. "When I am rich and famous, Edna," he told her, "this will be your social security.' The stories and poems show Brautigan as hopelessly lovestruck, cheerily goofy, and at his most disarmingly innocent. We see not only a young man and young artist about to bloom, but also the whole literary sensibility of the 1960s counterculture about to spread its wings and fly.]]></book_description>
