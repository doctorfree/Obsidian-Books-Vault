    <book_description><![CDATA[Throughout history, Western culture has been bedeviled by false prophets, charlatans, and self-appointed messianic figures. Their appetites for destruction and depravity have led to broken lives and worse-mass suicide and even mass murder. Why does this occur again and again?<br /><br />In <em>Rogue Messiahs</em>, Colin Wilson compellingly recounts the stories and outrageous claims, acts, and abuses of 25 self-proclaimed messiahs who have arisen in the last 300 years. He uncovers the probable factors that turn earnest religious leaders, mystics, or well-intentioned cult leaders into violent, abusive, murderous, and paranoid <em>rogue</em> messiahs.<br /><br />This gallery of spiritual fakers includes many familiar names and faces: David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians; Shoko Asahara, founder of the Aum Supreme Truth cult; Rev. Jim Jones; founder of the infamous Jonestown; Jeffrey Don Lundgren, Mormon con man and murderer; Ervil LeBaron and family, deranged cultist, prophets, and murderers; Rock Theriault, late twentieth-century French Canadian self-proclaimed messiah. Further, Wilson includes a study of others who achieved spiritual insight instead of destruction, and demonstrates that mayhem and benevolence are often two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />These would-be messiahs, in Wilson's analysis, are all driven by a childish dream of absolute power. Almost always, they cross the line from inspiration to paranoia, and from the teaching to killing-genuine aspiration mixed with self-deception, says Wilson. This is an incisive review of the motives and madness of cult leaders, spiritual con men, and would-be saviors.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Philip K. Dick said that his purpose as a writer was "to pierce through the veil of what is only apparently real and get to what is really real." Meditation upon the nature of reality leads one down strange pathways. Nothing is as it seems. This is a book about a man who experienced this, expressed it brilliantly, and refused to stop at that, devoting himself instead in his works to the passionate and often comical search for what is, if it isn't what it seems to be.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Known for his meaty seriocomic novels, Tom Robbins’s shorter work has appeared in publications ranging from <i>Esquire</i> to <i>Harper’s</i>, from <i>Playboy</i> to the <i>New York Times</i>. Collected here for the first time in paperback, the essays, articles, observations—and even some untypical country-music lyrics—offer a rare overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original.<b> <br /><br /></b>Whether rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso’s <i>Guernica,</i> lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls “the genius waitress,” Tom Robbins’s briefer writings exhibit the five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language. Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are brand-new short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an offbeat assessment of our divided nation. Wherever you open <b>Wild Ducks Flying Backward</b><i>,</i> you’ll encounter the serious playfulness that percolates from the mind of a self-described “romantic Zen hedonist” and “stray dog in the banquet halls of culture.”]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Sometimes a writer has to revisit the classics, and here we find that "gonzo journalism"—gutsy first-person accounts wherein the author is part of the story—didn't originate with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5237.Hunter_S__Thompson" title="Hunter S. Thompson" rel="nofollow noopener">Hunter S. Thompson</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3083854.Tom_Wolfe" title="Tom Wolfe" rel="nofollow noopener">Tom Wolfe</a>. Aldous Huxley took some mescaline &amp; wrote about it some 10 or 12 years earlier than those others. The book he came up with is part bemused essay &amp; part mystical treatise—"suchness" is everywhere to be found while under the influence. This is a good example of essay writing, journal keeping &amp; the value of controversy—always—in one's work.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the outrageously filthy and oddly innocent comedienne Sarah Silverman comes a memoir—her first book—that is at once shockingly personal, surprisingly poignant, and still pee-in-your-pants funny. If you like Sarah’s television show The Sarah Silverman Program, or memoirs such as Chelsea Handler’s Are You There Vodka? It’s Me Chelsea and Artie Lange’s Too Fat to Fish, you’ll love The Bedwetter.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The mystic's moment of illumination shares with great poetry the liberating power of the deepest levels of consciousness. In the words of William Blake, "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to a man as it is, infinite."<br /><br />Poetry, Wilson argues, is a contradiction of the habitual prison of daily life and shows the way to transcend the ordinary world through an act of intense attention-and intention. The poet, like the mystic, is subject to sudden ""peak experiences"" when ""everything we look upon is blessed."" W.B. Yeats, Dostoevsky, Gautama Buddha, Kazantzakis, Van Gogh, Rupert Brooke, Arunja, Nietzsche, A.L. Rouse, Jacob Boehme, Suzuki, Edgar Allan Poe: their visionary understanding can generate an awareness in each of us of our potential to open the floodgates of inner energy that creates mystic experience.<br /><br />Colin Wilson first received international acclaim in 1956 for The Outsider. ""Ever since I was thirteen, I have been obsessed by the question of the nature of mystical experience,"" he writes, and from that time he has been on a quest of the mystical in poetry, religion, and psychology.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this brief, lively book of reminiscences, the man Allen Ginsberg called “a hero of American consciousness” describes his transformation from bohemian professor to avatar of the new age. In his typically wry, provocative style, Timothy Leary gives firsthand accounts of his interrogation before Congress, Robert F. Kennedy’s LSD use, his own flamboyant campaign for governor of California, and much more.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In a volume that is penetrating, introspective, incisive, and laugh-out-loud funny, one of the great men of letters of this era—or any era—holds forth on life, art, sex, politics, and the state of America’s soul. Whether he is describing his coming of age in America, his formative war experiences, or his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, <i>A Man Without a Country</i> is intimate, tender, and brimming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegut’s passions.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this slim volume of essays, novelist/screenwriter McMurtry offers his refreshing views on movies, both junk (yea) and art (nay), Hollywood and its populace, the process of filmmaking, the power of money, film audiences, and critics. His experiences and thoughts on screenwriting, adapting novels, adapting one's own novels (a bad idea), and on the craft itself contain more useful information than a pile of how-to manuals. <br /><br />As in his novels, McMurtry is by turns witty, acerbic, and thoughtful; the pieces are surprisingly stylish in that the bulk of them (17 out of 21) were spun off on monthly deadlines (for American Film magazine, in 1975-77), and McMurtry admittedly can't remember writing most of them. A fine collection, from a fine writer.<br /><br />No Clue: Or Learning to Write for the Movies. --<br />The Hired Pen. --<br />The Deadline Syndrome. --<br />The Telephone Booth Screenwriter. --<br />The Fun of It All. --<br />All the President's Men, Seven Beauties, History, Innocence, Guilt, Redemption, and the Star System. --<br />The Screenplay as Non-Book: A Consideration. --<br />Pencils West: Or a Theory for the Shoot-'Em Up. --<br />"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and the Movie-Less Novelists. --<br />O Ragged Time Knit Up Thy Ravell'd Sleave. --<br />The Situation in Criticism: Reviewers, Critics, Professors. --<br />Character, the Tube, and the Death of Movies. --<br />The Disappearance of Love. --<br />Woody Allen, Keith Carradine, Lily Tomlin, and the Disappearance of Grace. --<br />The Last Picture Shows. --<br />The Seasons of L.A.. --<br />The Last Movie Column. --<br />The Last Picture Show: A Last Word. --<br />Approaching Cheyenne ...

    <book_description><![CDATA[Writing with characteristic grace and wit, Larry McMurtry tackles the full spectrum of his favorite themes -- from sex, literature, and cowboys to rodeos, small-town folk, and big-city slickers. <br /> First published in 1968, <i>In a Narrow Grave</i> is the classic statement of what it means to come from Texas. In these essays, McMurtry opens a window into the past and present of America's largest state. In his own words: <br /><br /><b>"Before I was out of high school, I realized I was witnessing the dying of a way of life -- the rural, pastoral way of life.

    <book_description><![CDATA[An alternate edition can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35955034-the-log-from-the-sea-of-cortez" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br /><br />In 1940 Steinbeck sailed in a sardine boat with his great friend the marine biologist, Ed Ricketts, to collect marine invertebrates from the beaches of the Gulf of California. The expedition was described by the two men in <i>Sea of Cortez</i>, published in 1941. The day-to-day story of the trip is told here in the Log, which combines science, philosophy and high-spirited adventure.<br /><br /><i>Log from the Sea of Cortez</i> includes the narrative of the journey and the essay “About Ed Ricketts.” It does not include pictures and detailed descriptions of the species collected by Steinbeck and Ricketts. (See also <i>Sea of Cortez</i>.)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[As only he can, Aldous Huxley explores the mind's remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness. These two astounding essays are among the most profound studies of the effects of mind-expanding drugs written in this century. Contains the complete texts of <i>
