    <book_description><![CDATA[From the author of “The Tell-Tale Heart,” “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and “The Murders in the Rue Morgue”.<br /><br />Although best known for his short stories, Edgar Allan Poe was by nature and choice a poet. This edition of his complete poetry illustrates the transcendent world of unity and ultimate beauty he created in his verse. From his exquisite lyric “To Helen” to his immortal masterpieces “Annabel Lee,” “The Bells,” and “The Raven,” Poe stands beside the celebrated English Romantic poets Shelley, Byron, and Keats, and his haunting, sensuous poetic vision profoundly influenced the Victorian giants Swinburne, Tennyson, and Rossetti.<br />  <br /> Today his dark side speaks eloquently to contemporary readers in his poems, such as “The Haunted Palace” and “The Conqueror Worm,” with their powerful images of madness and the macabre. But even at the end of his life, Poe reached out to his art for comfort and courage, giving us in “Eldorado” a talisman to hold during our darkest moments—a timeless gift from an American writer.<br />  <br /><b>With an Introduction by Jay Parini and an Afterword by April Bernard</b>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Neal Stephenson's dazzling novel <i>Snow Crash</i> set the science fiction world on fire, charting out the literary landscape of the next millennium with wild abandon. Now this acclaimed talent has again created a singular vision of the future. Imagine Charles Dickens writing in the 21st century...and you begin to imagine life in <i>The Diamond Age</i>.<br /><br />THE DIAMOND AGE<br /><br />Decades into our future, a stone's throw from the ancient city of Shanghai, a brilliant nanotechnologist named John Percival Hackworth has just broken the rigorous moral code of his tribe, the powerful neo-Victorians. He's made an illicit copy of a state-of-the-art interactive device called <i>A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</i>. Commissioned by an eccentric duke for his grandchild, stolen for Hackworth's own daughter, the <i>Primer</i>'s purpose is to educate and raise a girl capable of thinking for herself. It performs its function superbly. Unfortunately for Hackworth, his smuggled copy has fallen into the wrong hands.<br /><br />Young Nell and her brother Harv are thetes--members of the poor, tribeless class. Neglected by their mother, Harv looks after Nell. When he and his gang waylay a certain neo-Victorian--John Percival Hackworth--in the seamy streets of their neighborhood, Harv brings Nell something special: the <i>Primer</i>. And from the moment she opens the book, her life is changed. She enters a fairy tale in which she is the heroine, challenged with traversing an enchanted world in search of the fabled twelve keys. If successful, she could emerge with untold wisdom and power.<br /><br />Following the discovery of his crime, Hackworth begins an odyssey of his own. Expelled from the neo-Victorian paradise, squeezed by agents of Protocol Enforcement on one side and a Mandarin underworld crime lord on the other, he searches for an elusive figure known as the Alchemist. His quest and Nell's will ultimately lead them to another seeker whose fate is bound up with the <i>Primer</i>--a woman who holds the key to a vast, subversive information network that is destined to decode and reprogram the future of humanity.<br /><br />Vividly imagined, stunningly prophetic, and epic in scope, <i>The Diamond Age</i> is a major novel from one of the most visionary writers of our time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A mesmerising mystery story about friendship from the internationally bestselling author of <i>Norwegian Wood</i> and <i>1Q84</i></b><br /><br />Tsukuru Tazaki had four best friends at school. By chance all of their names contained a colour. The two boys were called Akamatsu, meaning ‘red pine’, and Oumi, ‘blue sea’, while the girls’ names were Shirane, ‘white root’, and Kurono, ‘black field’. Tazaki was the only last name with no colour in it.<br /><br />One day Tsukuru Tazaki’s friends announced that they didn't want to see him, or talk to him, ever again.<br /><br />Since that day Tsukuru has been floating through life, unable to form intimate connections with anyone. But then he meets Sara, who tells him that the time has come to find out what happened all those years ago.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Believe it or not, some readers find <i>Zodiac</i> even more fun than Neal Stephenson's defining 1990s cyberpunk novel, <i>Snow Crash</i>. <i>Zodiac</i> is set in Boston, and hero Sangamon Taylor (S. T.) ironically describes his hilarious exploits in the first person. S. T. is a modern superhero, a self-proclaimed Toxic Spiderman. With stealth, spunk, and the backing of GEE (a non-profit environmental group) as his weapons, S. T. chases down the bad guys with James Bond-like Zen. <p> Cruising Boston Harbor with lab tests and scuba gear, S. T. rides in with the ecosystem cavalry on his 40-horsepower Zodiac raft. His job of tracking down poisonous runoff and embarrassing the powerful corporations who caused them becomes more sticky than usual; run-ins with a gang of satanic rock fans, a deranged geneticist, and a mysterious PCB contamination that may or may not be man-made--plus a falling-out with his competent ("I adore stress") girlfriend--all complicate his mission. </p><p> Stephenson/S. T.'s irreverent, facetious, esprit-filled voice make this near-future tale a joy to read.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<em>The New York Times Book Review</em> called Neal Stephenson's most recent novel "electrifying" and "hilarious".  but if you want to know Stephenson was doing twenty years before he wrote the epic <em>Cryptonomicon</em>, it's back-to-school time. Back to The Big U, that is, a hilarious send-up of American college life starring after years out of print, <em>The Big U</em> is required reading for anyone interested in the early work of this singular writer.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Cryptonomicon</i> zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods—World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. "When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious."<br /><br />All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Internationally bestselling novelist and American icon Tom Robbins's long-awaited tale of his wild life and times, both at home and around the globe<br /><br />Tom Robbins's warm, wise, and wonderfully weird novels–including <em>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</em>, <em>Another Roadside Attraction</em>, and <em>Jitterbug Perfume</em>–provide an entryway into the frontier of his singular imagination. Madcap but sincere, pulsating with strong social and philosophical undercurrents, his irreverent classics have introduced countless readers to hitchhiking cowgirls, born-again monkeys, a philosophizing can of beans, exiled royalty, and problematic redheads.<br /><br />In <em>Tibetan Peach Pie</em>, Robbins turns that unparalleled literary sensibility inward, weaving together stories of his unconventional life–from his Appalachian childhood to his globe-trotting adventures–told in his unique voice, which combines the sweet and sly, the spiritual and earthy. The grandchild of Baptist preachers, Robbins would become, over the course of half a century, a poet interruptus, a soldier, a meteorologist, a radio DJ, an art-critic-turned-psychedelic-journeyman, a world-famous novelist, and a counterculture hero, leading a life as unlikely, magical, and bizarre as those of his quixotic characters.<br /><br />Robbins offers intimate snapshots of Appalachia during the Great Depression, the West Coast during the sixties' psychedelic revolution, international roving before Homeland Security monitored our travels, and New York publishing when it still relied on trees.<br /><br />Written with the big-hearted comedy and mesmerizing linguistic invention for which Robbins is known, <em>Tibetan Peach Pie</em> is an invitation into the private world of a literary legend.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I finally got around to reading the Tom Robbins memoir "Tibetan Peach Pie". What a fascinating life! And, as one would expect, Robbins does to memoirs what he previously did to the novel - this is much more than a simple recounting of a remarkable life, he manages to provoke a sense of wonder and awe even in this non-fiction format and continues to dazzle with the brilliance of his prose. Full of great funny provocative stories that reflect on not just the man and his writing but on our culture, consciousness, evolution, place in nature, the cosmic comedy, and everything.<br /><br />Thanks Tom Robbins!]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Want to know where Chuck Palahniuk's tonsils currently reside? <br />Been looking for a naked mannequin to hide in your kitchen cabinets? <br />Curious about Chuck's debut in an MTV music video? <br />What goes on at the Scum Center? <br />How do you get to the Apocalypse Café?<br /><br />In the closest thing he may ever write to an autobiography, Chuck Palahniuk provides answers to all these questions and more as he takes you through the streets, sewers, and local haunts of Portland, Oregon. <br /><br />According to Katherine Dunn, author of the cult classic <i>Geek Love</i>, Portland is the home of America's " fugitives and refugees." Get to know these folks, the " most cracked of the crackpots, "as Palahniuk calls them, and come along with him on an adventure through the parts of Portland you might not otherwise believe actually exist. No other travel guide will give you this kind of access to " a little history, a little legend, and a lot of friendly, sincere, fascinating people who maybe should've kept their mouths shut."<br /><br />Here are strange personal museums, weird annual events, and ghost stories. Tour the tunnels under downtown Portland. Visit swingers' sex clubs, gay and straight. See Frances Gabe's famous 1940s Self-Cleaning House. Look into strange local customs like the I-Tit-a-Rod Race and the Santa Rampage. Learn how to talk like a local in a quick vocabulary lesson. Get to know, I mean really get to know, the animals at the Portland zoo.<br /><br />Oh, the list goes on and on.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the way the world ends. Again.<br /><br />Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.<br /><br />Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.<br /><br /><br /><i>original cover of ISBN <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=0316229296" title="0316229296" rel="nofollow noopener">0316229296</a>/<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=9780316229296" title="9780316229296" rel="nofollow noopener">9780316229296</a></i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Hemingway Hoax is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning novella that weaves an intricate plot of a fake Hemingway manuscript with time travel, multiple universes, and the potential destruction of the omniverse itself. *** Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, lost a bag containing the manuscript of his first novel on a Parisian train. In 1996, John Baird, a renowned Hemingway scholar, decides to use that loss to account for a fake manuscript he creates. *** Little does Baird suspect that his attempt to pass off the forgery as a recovered Hemingway manuscript will take him on a journey involving parallel universes and time travel. For Hemingway's reputation is intricately linked to the fate of multiple worlds in the omniverse and any attempt to change that can have disastrous consequences.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A marvelous hybrid of mythology and mystery, <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> is the extraordinary literary thriller that launched Haruki Murakami’s international reputation. <br /><br />It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company’s advertisement. What he doesn’t realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> is Murakami at his astounding best.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>original cover of ISBN <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=0679753796" title="0679753796" rel="nofollow noopener">0679753796</a></i><br /><br />In this propulsive novel by the author of <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i> and <i>The Elephant Vanishes</i>, one of the most idiosyncratically brilliant writers at work in any language fuses science fiction, the hard-boiled thriller and white-hot satire into a new element of the literary periodic table.<br /><br />As he searches for a mysteriously vanished girlfriend, Haruki Murakami's protagonist plunges into a wind tunnel of sexual violence and metaphysical dread in which he collides with call girls; plays chaperone to a lovely teenaged psychic; and receives cryptic instructions from a shabby but oracular Sheep Man. <i>Dance Dance Dance</i> is a tense, poignant, and often hilarious ride through the cultural Cuisinart that is contemporary Japan, a place where everything that is not up for sale is up for grabs.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A race for survival among the stars... Humanity's last survivors escaped earth's ruins to find a new home. But when they find it, can their desperation overcome its dangers?<br /><br />WHO WILL INHERIT THIS NEW EARTH?<br /><br />The last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age—a world terraformed and prepared for human life.<br /><br />But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare.<br /><br />Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Ancillary Mercy</i> is the stunning conclusion to the trilogy that began with <i>Ancillary Justice</i>, the only novel ever to win the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke Awards.<br /><br />For a moment, things seemed to be under control for Breq, the soldier who used to be a warship. Then a search of Athoek Station's slums turns up someone who shouldn't exist and a messenger from the mysterious Presger empire arrives, as does Breq's old enemy, the divided, heavily armed, and possibly insane Anaander Mianaai—ruler of an empire at war with itself.<br /><br />Breq could flee with her ship and crew, but that would leave the people of Athoek in terrible danger. Breq has a desperate plan. The odds aren't good, but that's never stopped her before.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Seeking atonement for past crimes, Breq takes on a mission as captain of a troublesome new crew of Radchai soldiers, in the sequel to Ann Leckie's NYT bestselling, award-winning Ancillary Justice. A must read for fans of Ursula K. Le Guin and James S. A. Corey.</b><br /><br />Breq is a soldier who used to be a warship. Once a weapon of conquest controlling thousands of minds, now she has only a single body and serves the emperor.<br /><br />With a new ship and a troublesome crew, Breq is ordered to go to the only place in the galaxy she would agree to go: to Athoek Station to protect the family of a lieutenant she once knew - a lieutenant she murdered in cold blood.<br /><br />Ann Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy has become one of the new classics of science fiction. Beautifully written and forward thinking, it does what good science fiction does best, taking readers to bold new worlds with plenty explosions along the way.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Born in '80, Dr Jim Parsons undergoes abrupt involuntary time travel from 2012 to 2405 to find his profession treated disdainfully. Population is static, with no natural births. Only death allows an embryo's formation. The society's ambivalent about death. Eugenics ensures successive generations better benefit the species. By killing the weak, poverty &amp; disease are eliminated &amp; survival is optimized. A single race derived from African- &amp; Native Americans controls this world. Caucasians were wiped out or integrated centuries earlier.<br /> Parsons cures a woman, not knowing this is a crime. Chancellor Al Stenog exiles him to Mars. The spaceship is intercepted &amp; Parsons is returned to a deserted far future Earth. On finding a marker with instructions on operating the spaceship's time travel controls, he's directed to an Amerind tribal lodge, where he must perform surgery to save the life of a wounded time traveller, Corith, after the latter had died from an arrow wound. Parsons extracts it. It later mysteriously rematerializes in Corith's body.<br /> To resolve the situation, Parsons &amp; Corith's relatives travel back to Corith's previous assignment in 1579 on N. America's west coast, where Corith was to kill Francis Drake to alter history &amp; preserve Amerind lifeways against European subjugation. Observing the assassination attempt, Parsons realizes Drake is actually Stenog, lying in wait for Corith. Parsons tries warning Corith. Corith discovers Parsons is white &amp; attacks him. Struggling, Parsons inadvertently stabs Corith's heart with an arrow meant for Drake.<br /> In retribution, Parsons is left stranded by Corith's relatives in 1597, by which time the Europeans had departed. Parsons is rescued by Loris, Corith's daughter, when she learns she'll have Parson's child in the future. Briefly back in 2405, Parsons realizes the reason the arrow mysteriously reappeared in Corith's chest was because he'd murdered him for a 2nd time to cover his tracks. If Corith recovered, he'd have revealed it was Parsons who killed him &amp; an unwitting Parsons from slightly earlier would've been helpless at the hands Corith's relatives. As he stands over Corith, ready to kill him a 2nd time, he decides against it &amp; tries fleeing. Before doing so, two people appear in the room from the future &amp; kill Corith with the 2nd arrow. Parsons realizes the murderers are children he'd had with Loris, traveling back to 2405 from a more distant future.<br /> His children take Parsons forward in time to meet with Loris again. He struggles with the decision to return to 2012. Eventually he returns to the same day he'd left &amp; to the doting wife who saw him off that morning. He sets about his old life, a new task at hand. The novel ends with him placing the stone marker that'll save his life on a desolate future Earth.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[With The Three-Body Problem, English-speaking readers got their first chance to experience the multiple-award-winning and bestselling Three-Body Trilogy by China's most beloved science fiction author, Cixin Liu. Three-Body was released to great acclaim including coverage in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. It was also named a finalist for the Nebula Award, making it the first translated novel to be nominated for a major SF award since Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities in 1976.<br /><br />Now this epic trilogy concludes with Death's End. Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.<br /><br />Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early 21st century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die in its cradle?<br /><br />Ein halbes Jahrhundert nach der Entscheidungsschlacht hält der Waffenstillstand mit den Trisolariern immer noch stand. Die Hochtechnologie der Außerirdischen hat der Erde zu neuem Wohlstand verholfen, auch die Trisolarier haben dazugelernt, und eine friedliche Koexistenz scheint möglich. Der Frieden hat die Menschheit allerdings unvorsichtig werden lassen. Als mit Cheng Xin eine Raumfahrtingenieurin des 21. Jahrhunderts aus dem Kälteschlaf erwacht, bringt sie das Wissen um ein längst vergangenes Geheimprogramm in die neue Zeit. Wird die junge Frau den Frieden mit Trisolaris ins Wanken bringen – oder wird die Menschheit die letzte Chance ergreifen, sich weiterzuentwickeln?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the second novel in "Remembrance of Earth’s Past", the near-future trilogy written by China's multiple-award-winning science fiction author, Cixin Liu. <br /><br />In <i>The Dark Forest</i>, Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion — four centuries in the future. The aliens' human collaborators have been defeated but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's defense plans are exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret. <br /><br />This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he's the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris wants dead.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II.<br /><br />In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.<br /><br />Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.<br /><br />Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet, The Birdcatcher. This translation by Jay Rubin is in collaboration with the author.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Paul McCartney and John Lennon described him as the Beatles' "favorite group," he won Grammy awards, wrote and recorded hit songs, and yet no figure in popular music is as much of a paradox, or as underrated, as Harry Nilsson.<br /><br />In this first ever full-length biography, Alyn Shipton traces Nilsson's life from his Brooklyn childhood to his Los Angeles adolescence and his gradual emergence as a uniquely talented singer-songwriter. With interviews from friends, family, and associates, and material drawn from an unfinished autobiography, Shipton probes beneath the enigma to discover the real Harry Nilsson. A major celebrity at a time when huge concerts and festivals were becoming the norm, Nilsson shunned live performance. His venue was the studio, his stage the dubbing booth, his greatest triumphs masterful examples of studio craft. He was a gifted composer of songs for a wide variety of performers, including the Ronettes, the Yardbirds, and the Monkees, yet Nilsson's own biggest hits were almost all written by other songwriters. He won two Grammy awards, in 1969 for "Everybody's Talkin'" (the theme song for Midnight Cowboy), and in 1972 for "Without You," had two top ten singles, numerous album successes, and wrote a number of songs--"Coconut" and "Jump into the Fire," to name just two--that still sound remarkably fresh and original today. He was once described by his producer Richard Perry as "the finest white male singer on the planet," but near the end of his life, Nilsson's career was marked by voice-damaging substance abuse and the infamous deaths of both Keith Moon and Mama Cass in his London flat.<br /><br />Drawing on exclusive access to Nilsson's papers, Alyn Shipton's biography offers readers an intimate portrait of a man who has seemed both famous and unknowable--until now.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Rudy Rucker has seen the future. . .and it is extreme.The Godfather of cyberpunk--a mad scientist bravely meddling in the outrageous and heretical--Rucker created Bopper Robots, who rebelled against human society in his award-winning classic "Software.<br /><br />Now, in 2053, "moldies" are the latest robotic advancement--evolved artificial lifeforms made of soft plastic and gene-tweaked molds and algae, so anatomically inventive and universally despised that their very presence on the planet has thrown the entire low-rent future into a serious tailspin. So the moon is the place to be, if you're a persecuted "moldie" or an enlightened "flesher" intent an creating a new, more utopian hybrid civilization. Of course up there, there are other intergalactic intelligences to contend with--and some not so intelligent--who have their own agendas and appetites.<br /><br />This is scientific fabulation at its most brazenly inventive--funny, cutting-edge and deeply informed. No writer alive puts it all together like Rudy Rucker.Artificial life forms made of soft plastic and gene-tweaked mold and algae, moldies are evolved robots in the year 2053--anatomically inventive and universally despised. In a sleazy, low-rent future, sexual fraternization with moldies is strictly taboo--a societal sin that is of no concern whatsoever to Randy Karl Tucker. A Kentucky boy who has seriously strayed from the Heritagist religion's stern teachings about the evils of artificial life, Randy feels a definite something for Monique, moldie bookkeeper and maid at the Clearlight Terrace Court Motel But Monique1s sudden and inexplicable abduction from the planet--coupled with unsettling revelations about Randy1s own dubiousorigins--is dragging the degenerate flesher and all those around him into an ugly, conspiratorial mess. . .even as it pulls an unsuspecting humanity ever-closer to a stunning encounter with intergalactic intelligence.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Now in paperback, the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller by one of rock's most provocative figures <em>Scar Tissue</em> is Anthony Kiedis's searingly honest memoir of a life spent in the fast lane. <br /><br />In 1983, four self-described "knuckleheads" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk. Over twenty years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, against all odds, have become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has gone through many incarnations, Anthony Kiedis, the group's lyricist and dynamic lead singer, has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride. Whether he's recollecting the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses, or retracing a journey that has included appearances as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess. <br /><br /><i>Scar Tissue</i> is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption--a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In her short lifetime, Flannery O'Connor became one of the most distinctive American writers of the twentieth century. By birth a native of Georgia and a Roman Catholic, O'Connor depicts, in all its comic and horrendous incongruity, the limits of worldly wisdom and the mysteries of divine grace in the "Christ-haunted" Protestant South. This <em>Library of America</em> collection, the most comprehensive ever published, contains all of her novels and short-story collections, as well as nine other stories, eight of her most important essays, and a selection of 259 witty, spirited, and revealing letters, twenty-one published here for the first time.<br /><br />Her fiction brilliantly explores the human obsession with seemingly banal things. It might be a new hat or clean hogs or, for Hazel Motes, hero of <i>Wise Blood</i> (1952), an automobile. "Nobody with a good car needs to be justified," Hazel assures himself while using its hood for a pulpit to preach his "Church Without Christ." As in O'Connor's subsequent work, the characters in this novel are driven to violence, even murder, and their strong vernacular endows them with the discomforting reality of next-door neighbors. "In order to recognize a freak," she remarks in one of her essays, "you have to have a conception of the whole man."<br /><br />In the title story of her first, dazzling collection of stories, <i>A Good Man Is Hard to Find</i> (1955), the old grandmother discovers the comic irrelevance of good manners when she and her family meet up with the sinister Misfit, who claims there is "no pleasure but meanness." The terror of urban dislocation in "The Artificial Nigger," the bizarre baptism in "The River," or one-legged Hulga Hopewell's encounter with a Bible salesman in "Good Country People"--these startling events give readers the uneasy sense of mysteries about to be revealed.<br /><br />Her second novel, <i>The Violent Bear It Away</i> (1960), casts the shadow of the Old Testament across a landscape of backwoods shacks, modern towns, and empty highways. Caught between the prophetic fury of his great-uncle and the unrelenting rationalism of his uncle, fourteen-year-old Francis Tarwater undergoes a terrifying trial of faith when he is commanded to baptize his idiot cousin.<br /><br />The nine stories in <i>Everything That Rises Must Converge</i> (1965) show O'Connor's powers at their height. The title story is a terrifying, heart-rending drama of familial and racial misunderstanding. "Revelation" and "The Enduring Chill" probe further into conflicts between parental figures and recalcitrant offspring, where as much tension is generated from quiet conversation as from the physical violence of gangsters and fanatics.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>In <em>After Dark</em>—a gripping novel of late night encounters—Murakami’s trademark humor and psychological insight are distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.</b><br /><br />Nineteen-year-old Mari is waiting out the night in an anonymous Denny’s when she meets a young man who insists he knows her older sister, thus setting her on an odyssey through the sleeping city. In the space of a single night, the lives of a diverse cast of Tokyo residents—models, prostitutes, mobsters, and musicians—collide in a world suspended between fantasy and reality. Utterly enchanting and infused with surrealism, <em>After Dark</em> is a thrilling account of the magical hours separating midnight from dawn.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>"A billion husbands are about to be replaced."</b><br /><br />From the author of <i>Fight Club</i>, the classic portrait of the damaged contemporary male psyche, now comes this novel about the apocalyptic marketing possibilities of a new product that gives new meaning to the term "self-help." <br /><br />Penny Harrigan is a low-level associate in a big Manhattan law firm with an apartment in Queens and no love life at all. So it comes as a great shock when she finds herself invited to dinner by one C. Linus Maxwell, a software mega-billionaire and lover of the most gorgeous and accomplished women on earth. After dining at Manhattan's most exclusive restaurant, he whisks Penny off to a hotel suite in Paris, where he proceeds, notebook in hand, to bring her to previously undreamed-of heights of gratification for days on end. What's not to like? <br /><br />This: Penny discovers that she is a test subject for the final development of a line of feminine products to be marketed in a nationwide chain of boutiques called Beautiful You. So potent and effective are these devices that women by the millions line up outside the stores on opening day and then lock themselves in their room with them and stop coming out. Except for batteries. Maxwell's plan for battery-powered world domination must be stopped. But how?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Candide</i> is the story of a gentle man who, though pummeled and slapped in every direction by fate, clings desperately to the belief that he lives in "the best of all possible worlds." On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan. Fast, funny, often outrageous, the French philosopher's immortal narrative takes Candide around the world to discover that -- contrary to the teachings of his distinguished tutor Dr. Pangloss -- all is not always for the best. Alive with wit, brilliance, and graceful storytelling, <i>Candide</i> has become Voltaire's most celebrated work.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the author of the underground sensation <i>Fight Club</i> comes this wickedly incisive second novel, a mesmerizing, unnerving, and hilarious vision of cult and post-cult life.<br /><br />Tender Branson—last surviving member of the so-called Creedish Death Cult—is dictating his life story into the flight recorder of Flight 2039, cruising on autopilot at 39,000 feet somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He is all alone in the airplane, which will crash shortly into the vast Australian outback. Before it does, he will unfold the tale of his journey from an obedient Creedish child and humble domestic servant to an ultra-buffed, steroid- and collagen-packed media messiah, author of a best-selling autobiography, <i>Saved from Salvation</i>, and the even better selling <i>Book of Very Common Prayer</i> (The Prayer to Delay Orgasm, The Prayer to Prevent Hair Loss, The Prayer to Silence Car Alarms). He'll reveal the truth of his tortured romance with the elusive and prescient Fertility Hollis, share his insight that "the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage," and deny responsibility for the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill, a 20,000-acre repository for the nation's outdated pornography. Among other matters both bizarre and trenchant.<br /><br />Not since Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Mother Night</i> and Jerzy Kosinski's <i>Being There</i> has there been as dark and telling a satire on the wages of fame and the bedrock lunacy of the modern world. Unpredictable, compelling, and unforgettable, <i>Survivor</i> is Chuck Palahniuk at his deadpan peak; and it cements his place as one of the most original writers in fiction today.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA['A narrative particle accelerator that zooms between Wild Turkey Whiskey and Bob Dylan, unicorn skulls and voracious librarians, John Coltrane and <i>Lord Jim</i>. Science fiction, detective story and post-modern manifesto all rolled into one rip-roaring novel, <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i> is the tour de force that expanded Haruki Murakami's international following. Tracking one man's descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.']]></book_description>

Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami’s characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Kafka on the Shore</i>, a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Chrissie Hynde, for nearly four decades the singer/songwriter/ undisputed leader of the Pretenders, is a justly legendary figure.</b> <br /><br />Few other rock stars have managed to combine her swagger, sexiness, stage presence, knack for putting words to music, gorgeous voice and just all-around kick-assedness into such a potent and alluring package. From “Tatooed Love Boys” and “Brass in Pocket” to “Talk of the Town” and “Back on the Chain Gang,” her signature songs project a unique mixture of toughness and vulnerability that millions of men and women have related to. A kind of one- woman secret tunnel linking punk and new wave to classic guitar rock, she is one of the great luminaries in rock history. <br />  <br /> Now, in her no-holds-barred memoir <i>Reckless, </i>Chrissie Hynde tells, with all the fearless candor, sharp humor and depth of feeling we’ve come to expect, exactly where she came from and what her crooked, winding path to stardom entailed. Her All-American upbringing in Akron, Ohio, a child of postwar power and prosperity. Her soul capture, along with tens of millions of her generation, by the gods of sixties rock who came through Cleveland—Mitch Ryder, David Bowie, Jeff Back, Paul Butterfield and Iggy Pop among them. Her shocked witness in 1970 to the horrific shooting of student antiwar protestors at Kent State. Her weakness for the sorts of men she calls “the heavy bikers” and “the get-down boys.” Her flight from Ohio to London in 1973 essentially to escape the former and pursue the latter. Her scuffling years as a brash reviewer for <i>New Musical Express, </i>shop girl at the Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood boutique 'Craft Must Wear Clothes But The Truth Loves To Go Naked', first-hand witness to the birth of the punk movement, and serial band aspirant. And then ,at almost the last possible moment, her meeting of the three musicians who comprised the original line-up of The Pretenders, their work on the indelible first album “The Pretenders,” and the rocket ride to “Instant” stardom, with all the disorientation and hazards that involved. The it all comes crashing back down to earth with the deaths of lead guitarist James Honeyman Scott and bassist Peter Farndon, leaving her bruised and saddened, but far from beaten. Because Chrissie Hynde is, among other things, one of rock’s great survivors. <br />  <br /> We are lucky to be living in a golden age of great rock memoirs. In the aptly titled <i>Reckless</i>, Chrissie Hynde has given us one of the very best we have. Her mesmerizing presence radiates from every line and page of this book.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[After 1905, Einstein's miraculous year, physics would never be the same again. In those twelve months, Einstein shattered many cherished scientific beliefs with five extraordinary papers that would establish him as the world's leading physicist. This book brings those papers together in an accessible format. The best-known papers are the two that founded special relativity: <i>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</i> and <i>Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?</i> In the former, Einstein showed that absolute time had to be replaced by a new absolute: the speed of light. In the second, he asserted the equivalence of mass and energy, which would lead to the famous formula <i>E = mc2<br /></i>.<br /><br /><br />The book also includes <i>On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</i>, in which Einstein challenged the wave theory of light, suggesting that light could also be regarded as a collection of particles. This helped to open the door to a whole new world--that of quantum physics. For ideas in this paper, he won the Nobel Prize in 1921.<br /><br /><br />The fourth paper also led to a Nobel Prize, although for another scientist, Jean Perrin. <i>On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat</i> concerns the Brownian motion of such particles. With profound insight, Einstein blended ideas from kinetic theory and classical hydrodynamics to derive an equation for the mean free path of such particles as a function of the time, which Perrin confirmed experimentally. The fifth paper, <i>A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions</i>, was Einstein's doctoral dissertation, and remains among his most cited articles. It shows how to calculate Avogadro's number and the size of molecules.<br /><br /><br />These papers, presented in a modern English translation, are essential reading for any physicist, mathematician, or astrophysicist. Far more than just a collection of scientific articles, this book presents work that is among the high points of human achievement and marks a watershed in the history of science.<br /><br /><br /> Coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the miraculous year, this new paperback edition includes an introduction by John Stachel, which focuses on the personal aspects of Einstein's youth that facilitated and led up to the miraculous year.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Stories you'll never forget—just try—from literature's favorite transgressive author <br /><br />Representing work that spans several years, Make Something Up is a compilation of 21 stories and one novella (some previously published, some not) that will disturb and delight. The absurdity of both life and death are on full display; in "Zombies," the best and brightest of a high school prep school become tragically addicted to the latest drug craze: electric shocks from cardiac defibrillators. In "Knock, Knock," a son hopes to tell one last off-color joke to a father in his final moments, while in "Tunnel of Love," a massage therapist runs the curious practice of providing 'relief' to dying clients. And in "Expedition," fans will be thrilled to find to see a side of Tyler Durden never seen before in a precursor story to Fight Club.<br /><br />Funny, caustic, bizarre, poignant; these stories represent everything readers have come to love and expect from Chuck Palahniuk. They have all the impact of a sharp blow to the solar plexus, with considerable collateral damage to the funny bone.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the master of literary mayhem and provocation, a full-frontal Triple X novel that goes where no American work of fiction has gone before</b><br /><br />Cassie Wright, porn priestess, intends to cap her legendary career by breaking the world record for serial fornication. On camera. With six hundred men. <i>Snuff</i> unfolds from the perspectives of Mr. 72, Mr. 137, and Mr. 600, who await their turn on camera in a very crowded green room. This wild, lethally funny, and thoroughly researched novel brings the huge yet underacknowledged presence of pornography in contemporary life into the realm of literary fiction at last. Who else but Chuck Palahniuk would dare do such a thing? Who else could do it so well, so unflinchingly, and with such an incendiary (you might say) climax?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The hyperactive love child of <i>Page Six</i> and <i>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</i> caught in a tawdry love triangle with <i>The Fan</i>. Even Kitty Kelly will blush. </b><br /><br />Soaked, nay, marinated in the world of vintage Hollywood, <i>Tell-All</i> is a <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>–inflected homage to Old Hollywood when <b>Bette Davis</b> and <b>Joan Crawford</b> ruled the roost; a veritable Tourette’s syndrome of rat-tat-tat  name-dropping, from the A-list to the Z-list; and a merciless  send-up of <b>Lillian Hellman</b>’s habit of butchering the truth that will have <b>Mary McCarthy</b> cheering from the beyond. <br /><br />Our <b>Thelma Ritter</b>–ish narrator is <b>Hazie Coogan</b>, who for decades has tended to the outsized needs of <b>Katherine “Miss Kathie”  Kenton</b>—veteran of multiple marriages, career comebacks, and cosmetic surgeries. But danger arrives with gentleman caller <b>Webster Carlton Westward III</b>, who worms his way into Miss Kathie’s heart (and boudoir). Hazie discovers that this bounder has already written a celebrity tell-all memoir foretelling Miss Kathie’s death in a forthcoming <b>Lillian Hellman</b>–penned musical extravaganza; as the body count mounts, Hazie must execute a plan to save <b>Katherine Kenton</b> for her fans—and for posterity. <br /><br /><i>Tell-All</i> is funny, subversive, and fascinatingly clever. It’s wild, it’s wicked, it’s  <b>boldfaced</b>—it’s vintage <b>Chuck</b>.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In all of the obituaries and writing about Richard Brautigan that appeared after his suicide, none revealed to Ianthe Brautigan the father she knew. Through it took all of her courage, she delved into her memories, good and bad, to retrieve him, and began to write. <i>You Can't Catch Death </i>is a frank, courageous, heartbreaking reflection on both a remarkable man and the child he left behind.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For his eighteenth birthday, Dusty Baker's parents gave him a great present: Two tickets to the Monterey Pop Festival of June 1967, a three-day event featuring more than thirty bands, and use of the family station wagon for the weekend so young Dusty could drive down from Sacramento to the Monterey Bay Area. He was another young person, trying to take it all in, sleeping on the beach with his buddy, having the time of his life soaking up the vibe and every different musical style represented there. Baker's lifelong love of music was set in motion, his wide-ranging, eclectic tastes, everything from country to hip-hop. He also caught the Jimi Hendrix Experience, who put on such a show that to this day Baker calls Hendrix the most exciting performer he's ever seen. He went on to years of friendship with musicians from B.B. King and John Lee Hooker to Elvin Bishop. This account grabs a reader from page one and never lets up.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This has no isbn number. The back page has what appears to be a Chinese inscription including the numerals "59". The preface, written by Hemingway in 1938, indicates the stories were written between 1921 and 1938. A search reveals this is likely a bootleg copy of the 1st edition hardcover published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1953.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Suddenly one April the rats in Oran came of cellars and sewers, first singly and then in tens and hundreds, to die in the streets. At first the citizens of Oran refused to connect this with the mounting human death rate. But finally the implications had to be acknowledged; the Prefect telegraphed: <i>Proclaim a state of plague stop close the town.</i><br />A doctor, a journalist, a minor government official, a criminal avoiding the police, and a priest are among those imprisoned by the plague. Their reactions vary according to the character and philosophy of each: commitment to the human struggle, panic, unquestioning action, philosophic justification.<br />In its searching, symbolic exploration of the human conscience, <i>The Plague</i> is the most important novel to have come out of postwar Europe. It is a classic not only of the twentieth century, but ranks with the great novels of all time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[“The incomparable and mysterious Sandy Koufax is revealed…. This is an absorbing book, beautifully written.” —<em>Wall Street Journal</em><br /><br />“Leavy has hit it out of the park…A lot more than a biography. It’s a consideration of how we create our heroes, and how this hero’s self perception distinguishes him from nearly every other great athlete in living memory… a remarkably rich portrait.” — <em>Time</em><br /><br />The instant <em>New York Times</em> bestseller about the baseball legend and famously reclusive Dodgers’ pitcher Sandy Koufax, from award-winning former <em>Washington Post</em> sportswriter Jane Leavy. <em>Sandy Koufax</em> reveals, for the first time, what drove the three-time Cy Young award winner to the pinnacle of baseball and then—just as quickly—into self-imposed exile.]]></book_description>

The legendary Hall-of-Fame outfielder was a national hero during his record-setting career with the New York Yankees, but public revelations of alcoholism, infidelity, and family strife badly tarnished the ballplayer's reputation in his latter years. In <em>The Last Boy</em>, Leavy plumbs the depths of the complex athlete, using copious first-hand research as well as her own memories, to show why The Mick remains the most beloved and misunderstood Yankee slugger of all time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[You are part of the grand transition that is underway in energy, but you are probably wondering what it all means for you. Human society has committed to getting off fossil fuels because they are warming our planet, and this shift will engage everyone. Why? Because everyone uses energy. Today you have choices in energy that you never had before, and your choices will affect many generations to come. This book will bring you up to speed on your many options in energy, all explained in terms that anyone can understand.<br /><br />Power Shift: From Fossil Energy to Dynamic Solar Power retells human history through the lens of energy, explains the science behind the crisis–in clear, succinct language that anyone can understand—and provides a detailed blueprint for the future, from governmental, commercial, and individual perspectives.<br /><br />Today, we’ve become mired in partisan bickering among politicians and oil, gas, and coal lobbying interests who insist that fossil fuels are necessary for jobs and the US economy. However, this narrow debate has failed to notice that the world has already embarked on a transformation in how we use energy that is so fundamental, it defines a new Solar Epoch, as monumental as the discovery of fire, the development of agriculture, and the exploitation of fossil fuels in previous centuries.<br /><br />The truth is that solar power–getting radically cheaper by the year–is not only a viable solution but, as the author states, “forms a clean energy system that can completely replace fossil fuels. We can gradually phase them in so that in 50 years we’ll be 100% solar-powered. And because solar energy does not run out like fossil fuels, we will never need to go looking for another energy source again.”<br />Unlike other books on global warming and solar energy, Power Shift presents visionary plans for governments, corporations, and individuals concerned about climate change.<br /><br />And the author has “put his money where his mouth is.” Having built a solar home in Santa Cruz County in 1997 and outfitted it with an off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) system, Stayton cites numerous personal examples to inspire others to take similar action.<br /><br />Destined to become a classic in the field, and soon to be adopted as a basic text in college and university environmental studies programs, Power Shift is an indispensable reference for researchers and global leaders, a valuable staff training tool for solar companies, and a compelling, inspirational read for anyone eager to learn the truth about global warming and to participate “from the ground up” in the new Solar Epoch.<br /><br />Reader-friendly with beautiful illustrations and firmly grounded in current science, Power Shift also forges a cautionary tale of what lies ahead if we don’t start acting now: “We seem to be waiting for a sign,” Stayton writes, “a sudden event so catastrophic that it compels us to overcome political differences and take action. However, this disaster does not rush upon us like a hurricane, but instead slowly erodes our foundation, like termites. If we wait until the house collapses, we will have waited too long.”<br /><br />If you buy only one book on the topic of climate change or solar power–for yourself, family, friends, or colleagues–you can depend on Power Shift to serve as a comprehensive, eye-opening, educational resource for years to come.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this final volume of the internationally celebrated MaddAddam trilogy, the Waterless Flood has wiped out most of the population. Toby is part of a small band of survivors, along with the Children of Crake: the gentle, bioengineered quasi-human species who will inherit this new earth.<br /><br />As Toby explains their origins to the curious Crakers, her tales coheres into a luminous oral history that sets down humanity's past--and points toward its future. Blending action, humor, romance, and an imagination at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, <i>MaddAddam</i> is vintage Atwood--a moving and dramatic conclusion to her epic work of speculative fiction.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. <br /><br />Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers...<br /><br />Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away...<br /><br />By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, "The Year of the Flood" is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.]]></book_description>

Purchase of the Kindle edition includes wireless delivery.)<br /><br />'I felt something alive moving on my left leg ... when bending my Eyes downwards as much as I could. I perceived it to be a human Creature not six inches high'<br /><br />Shipwrecked and cast adrift, Lemuel Gulliver wakes to find himself on Lilliput, an island inhabited by little people, whose height makes their quarrels over fashion and fame seem ridiculous. His subsequent encounters - with the crude giants of Brobdingnag, the philosophical Houyhnhnms, and the brutish Yahoos - give Gulliver new, bitter insights into human behavior. Swift's savage satire view mankind in a distorted hall of mirrors as a diminished, magnified and finally bestial species, presenting us with an uncompromising reflection of ourselves.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The concluding volume of the Border trilogy. In this magnificent new novel, the National Book Award-winning author of <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> and <i>The Crossing</i> fashions a darkly beautiful elegy for the American frontier. It is 1952 and John Grady Cole and Billy Parham are working as ranch hands in New Mexico, not far from the proving grounds of Alamogordo and the cities of El Paso and Juarez. Their life is made up of trail drives and horse auctions and stories told by campfire light. They value that life all the more because they know it is about to change forever.<br /><br />The change comes when John Grady falls in love with a beautiful, ill-starred Mexican prostitute and sets in motion a chain of events as violent as they are unstoppable. Haunting in its beauty, filled with sorrow, humor, and awe, <i>Cities of the Plain</i> is a genuine American epic.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Nobel laureate Erwin Schrodinger's What is Life? is one of the great science classics of the twentieth century. It was written for the layman, but proved to be one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of DNA. What is Life? appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Brought together with these two classics are Schrodinger's autobiographical sketches, which offer a fascinating account of his life as a background to his scientific writings.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Oryx and Crake</b> is at once an unforgettable love story and a compelling vision of the future. Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A new collection of stories by one of America’s most beloved and admired short-story writers, her first in fifteen years, since Birds of America (“Fluid, cracked, mordant, colloquial . . . Will stand by itself as one of our funniest, most telling anatomies of human love and vulnerability.” —The New York Times Book Review, cover).<br />These eight masterly stories reveal Lorrie Moore at her most mature and in a perfect configuration of craft, mind, and bewitched spirit, as she explores the passage of time and summons up its inevitable sorrows and hilarious pitfalls to reveal her own exquisite, singular wisdom.<br /><br />In “Debarking,” a newly divorced man tries to keep his wits about him as the United States prepares to invade Iraq, and against this ominous moment, we see—in all its irresistible wit and darkness—the perils of divorce and what can follow in its wake . . .<br /><br />In “Foes,” a political argument goes grotesquely awry as the events of 9/11 unexpectedly manifest themselves at a fund-raising dinner in Georgetown . . . In “The Juniper Tree,” a teacher visited by the ghost of her recently deceased friend is forced to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in a kind of nightmare reunion . . . And in “Wings,” we watch the inevitable unraveling of two once-hopeful musicians, neither of whom held fast to their dreams nor struck out along other paths, as Moore deftly depicts the intricacies of dead-ends-ville and the workings of regret . . .<br /><br />Here are people beset, burdened, buoyed; protected by raising teenage children; dating after divorce; facing the serious illness of a longtime friend; setting forth on a romantic assignation abroad, having it interrupted mid-trip, and coming to understand the larger ramifications and the impossibility of the connection . . . stories that show people coping with large dislocation in their lives, with risking a new path to answer the desire to be in relation—to someone . . .<br /><br />Gimlet-eyed social observation, the public and private absurdities of American life, dramatic irony, and enduring half-cracked love wend their way through each of these narratives in a heartrending mash-up of the tragic and the laugh-out-loud—the hallmark of life in Lorrie-Moore-land.<br />--jacket]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Now available in an exquisite three volume box set: the erotic masterpiece from <b>Alan Moore</b>, the visionary behind <i>Watchmen</i>, <i>From Hell</i>, and <i>V for Vendetta</i>!<br /><br />For more than a century, Alice, Wendy, and Dorothy have been our guides through the Wonderland, Neverland, and Land of Oz of our childhoods. Now, like us, these three lost girls have grown up and are ready to guide us again, this time through the realms of our sexual awakening and fulfillment. Through their familiar fairy tales they share with us their most intimate revelations of desire in its many forms... revelations that shine out radiantly through the dark clouds of war gathering around a luxury Austrian hotel.<br /><br />Drawing on the rich heritage of erotica, <i>Lost Girls</i> is the rediscovery of the power of ecstatic writing and art in a sublime union that only the medium of comics can achieve. Exquisite, thoughtful, and human, <i>Lost Girls</i> is a work of breathtaking scope that challenges the very notion of art fettered by convention. This is erotic fiction at its finest.<br /><br />Similar to DC's Absolute editions of <i>Watchmen</i> and <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>, <i>Lost Girls</i> will be published as three, 112-page, super-deluxe, ovesized hardcover volumes, all sealed in a gorgeous slipcase. It will truly be an edition for the ages.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From a well-known actress and math geniusa groundbreaking guide to mathematics for middle school girls, their parents, and educators</b> <br /><br /> As the math education crisis in this country continues to make headlines, research continues to prove that it is in middle school when math scores begin to dropespecially for girlsin large part due to the relentless social conditioning that tells girls they can't do math, and that math is uncool. Young girls today need strong female role models to embrace the idea that it's okay to be smartin fact, it's sexy to be smart! <br /><br /> It's Danica McKellar's mission to be this role model, and demonstrate on a large scale that <i>math doesn't suck</i>. In this fun and accessible guide, McKellardubbed a math superstar by <i>The New York Times</i>gives girls and their parents the tools they need to master the math concepts that confuse middle-schoolers most, including fractions, percentages, pre-algebra, and more. The book features hip, real-world examples, step-by-step instruction, and engaging stories of Danica's own childhood struggles in math (and stardom). In addition, borrowing from the style of today's teen magazines, it even includes a Math Horoscope section, Math Personality Quizzes, and Real-Life Testimonialsultimately revealing why math is easier and cooler than readers think.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dramatized sequential illustrations with dialogue--an art form once confined to production of comic strips and comic books--has recently graduated into the popular, fast-growing, and often financially rewarding genre of the graphic novel. <i>Writing and Illustrating the Graphic Novel</i> is an authoritative instruction manual suitable for formal art class or for self teaching on the part of ambitious self-starters. Beginners who have artistic and storytelling aptitudes learn the basics of graphic novel creation, from first conception of a story idea to publication of a professionally produced book. An introductory chapter describes the widely differing graphic novel sub-genres and the appropriate styles for each. They include superhero, gothic tale, adventure/action story, sci-fi, crime story, and literary fiction. A succeeding chapter discusses and shows examples of picture panels, speech bubbles, layout, and characterization of works in progress. Subsequent chapters offer advice on finding inspiration for stories and explanation of the technique of writing for graphic novels. A variety of illustration and layout styles are shown with reference to ways in which each fits a different sub-genre. A final chapter presents practical tips on getting a graphic novel published. More than 400 illustrations take students step-by-step through the process of creating a graphic novel.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, and lightning does not travel in a straight line. The complexity of nature's shapes differs in kind, not merely degree, from that of the shapes of ordinary geometry, the geometry of fractal shapes.<br /><br />Now that the field has expanded greatly with many active researchers, Mandelbrot presents the definitive overview of the origins of his ideas and their new applications. <i>The Fractal Geometry of Nature</i> is based on his highly acclaimed earlier work, but has much broader and deeper coverage and more extensive illustrations.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In <i>Others Unknown</i>, Stephen Jones, Timothy McVeigh's lawyer in his trial for the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Office Building in Oklahoma City, provides the fullest possible account of the worst act of terrorism in American history. In a complete revision of his 1998 hardcover, Jones tells for the first time the whole story of his investigation of the case, including what he was told by McVeigh and what he learned about others involved in the conspiracy. His account differs significantly from the tale McVeigh is telling as he faces execution for his crimes.<br /><br /> In interviews with Buffalo News journalists, reported in their recently released book <i>American Terrorist</i>(ReganBooks, April 2000), McVeigh claims total responsibility for the bombing, saying "It was my choice and my control to hit that building when it was full." In <i>Others Unknown</i> Jones sets the record straight, saying what he could not say when he first wrote this book, before McVeigh effectively waived attorney-client privilege: that based on what he learned as McVeigh's counsel, Jones knows that the bombing was a conspiracy, and that McVeigh was not its mastermind. "I'm not trying to say he was innocent. He has exaggerated his guilt to protect others. He played a role, but he was a foot soldier, a mule, not the general," says Jones.<br /><br /> "I know it did not happen the way he tells it in his book."<br /><br /> Jones reports in detail what McVeigh told him as the case progressed; explains why McVeigh did not plead guilty; and shows McVeigh's real role in the conspiracy and how he obstructed his own defense. This is the definitive historical record of a heinous act of murderous rage; an account indispensable to understanding what happened. And, says PublicAffairs CEO and publisher Peter Osnos:<br /><br /> "We think it's important that Tim McVeigh not be given the final word."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This Hugo Award-winning graphic novel chronicles the fall from grace of a group of super-heroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the super-hero is dissected as the heroes are stalked by an unknown assassin.<br /><br />One of the most influential graphic novels of all time and a perennial best-seller, <i>Watchmen</i> has been studied on college campuses across the nation and is considered a gateway title, leading readers to other graphic novels such as <i>V for Vendetta</i>, <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> and <i>The Sandman</i> series.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> is the series of short stories that made the fortunes of the Strand magazine, in which they were first published, and won immense popularity for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. The detective is at the height of his powers and the volume is full of famous cases, including 'The Red-Headed League', 'The Blue Carbuncle', and 'The Speckled Band'. Although Holmes gained a reputation for infallibility, Conan Doyle showed his own realism and feminism by having the great detective defeated by Irene Adler - the woman - in the very first story, 'A Scandal in Bohemia'. <br />The editor of this volume, Richard Lancelyn Green is editor of <i>The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes</i> and <i>The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>. With John Michael Gibson, he compiled the Soho Series Bibliography of A. Conan Doyle.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Alexandre Dumas’s most famous tale— and possibly the most famous historical novel of all time— in a handsome hardcover volume.<br /><br />This swashbuckling epic of chivalry, honor, and derring-do, set in France during the 1620s, is richly populated with romantic heroes, unattainable heroines, kings, queens, cavaliers, and criminals in a whirl of adventure, espionage, conspiracy, murder, vengeance, love, scandal, and suspense. Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d’Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress “Milady”; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen—and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto “all for one, one for all” has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, <i>The Three Musketeers </i>is eternally entertaining.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Shaw began writing <i>Man and Superman</i> in 1901 and determined to write a play that would encapsulate the new century's intellectual inheritance. Shaw drew not only on Byron's verse satire, but also on Shakespeare, the Victorian comedy fashionable in his early life, and from authors from Conan Doyle to Kipling. In this powerful drama of ideas, Shaw explores the role of the artist, the function of women in society, and his theory of Creative Evolution. As Stanley Weintraub says in his new introduction, this is "the first great twentieth-century English play" and remains a classic exposé of the eternal struggle between the sexes.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Although extensively revised, this new edition continues in the fine tradition of its predecessor. Major changes include: a notation that formalizes the distinction between equality and congruence and between line, ray and line segment; a completely rewritten chapter on mathematical logic with inclusion of truth tables and the logical basis for the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries; expanded coverage of analytic geometry with more theorems discussed and proved with coordinate geometry; two distinct chapters on parallel lines and parallelograms; a condensed chapter on numerical trigonometry; more problems; expansion of the section on surface areas and volume; and additional review exercises at the end of each chapter. Concise and logical, it will serve as an excellent review of high school geometry.]]></book_description>

He goes to great length to establish the provenance of each part, and possible derivative works, including critical analyses of all major variations, utilizing fresh translations of earlier magical texts such as Johann Trithemius's Steganographia, The Archidoxes of Magic by Paracelsus, and newly discovered Hebrew manuscripts of the original Key of Solomon. Abundantly illustrated, Peterson includes reproductions of the original magical circles, tools, and seals of the spirits with variations of certain drawings from various sources and notae missing from earlier editions. Source list. Appendicies. Index.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The <i>I Ching</i>, or Book of Changes, is one of the 1st efforts of the human mind to place itself within the universe. It has exerted a living influence in China for 3000 years and interest in it has spread in the West. <br /><br />Set down in the dawn of history as a book of oracles, the Book of Changes deepened in meaning when ethical values were attached to the oracular pronouncements; it became a book of wisdom, eventually one of the Five Classics of Confucianism, and provided the common source for both Confucianist and Taoist philosophy. <br /><br />Wilhelm's rendering of the <i>I Ching</i> into German, published in 1924, presented it for the 1st time in a form intelligible to the general reader. Wilhelm, who translated many other ancient Chinese works and who wrote several books on Chinese philosophy and civilization, long resided in China. His close association with its cultural leaders gave him a unique understanding of the text of the <i>I Ching</i>. In the English translation, every effort has been made to preserve Wilhelm's pioneering insight into the spirit of the original.<br /><br />This 3rd edition, completely reset, contains a new forward by Hellmut Wilhelm, one of the most eminent American scholars of Chinese culture. He discusses his father's textual methods and summarizes recent studies of the <i>I Ching</i> both in the West and in present-day China. The new edition contains minor textual corrections, bibliographical revisions and an index.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<em>A hard-hitting, critically acclaimed trilogy of crime novels from an author about whom </em>New York<em> magazine has written, "What people say about Cormac McCarthy ... goes double for [Woodrell]. Possibly more."</em><br /><br />In the parish of St. Bruno, sex is easy, corruption festers, and double-dealing is a way of life. Rene Shade is an uncompromising detective swimming in a sea of filth. <br /><br />As Shade takes on hit men, porn kings, a gang of ex-cons, and the ghosts of his own checkered past, Woodrell's three seminal novels pit long-entrenched criminals against the hard line of the law, brother against brother, and two vastly different sons against a long-absent father.<br /><br />THE BAYOU TRILOGY highlights the origins of a one-of-a-kind author, a writer who for over two decades has created an indelible representation of the shadows of the rural American experience and has steadily built a devoted following among crime fiction aficionados and esteemed literary critics alike.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[It's been six weeks since angels of the apocalypse descended to demolish the modern world. Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back.<br /><br />Anything, including making a deal with an enemy angel.<br /><br />Raffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl.<br /><br />Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival. Together, they journey toward the angels' stronghold in San Francisco where she'll risk everything to rescue her sister and he'll put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A sharp and funny addition to Daniel Woodrell's collection of "country noir" novels, featuring anti-hero Sammy Barlach and Jamalee Merridew, her hair tomato red with rage and ambition.</b><br /><br /> In the Ozarks, what you are is where you are born. If you're born in Venus Holler, you're not much. For Jamalee Merridew, Venus Holler just won't cut it. Jamalee sees her brother Jason, blessed with drop-dead gorgeous looks and the local object of female obsession, as her ticket out of town. But Jason may just be gay, and in the hills and hollows of the Ozarks that is the most dangerous and courageous thing a man could be. <br /><br /> Enter Sammy Barlach, a loser ex-con passing through a tired nowhere on the way to a fresher nowhere. Jamalee thinks Sammy is just the kind of muscle she and Jason need.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Set in the border states of Kansas and Missouri, <i>Woe to Live on</i> explores the nature of lawlessness and violence, friendship and loyalty, through the eyes of young recruit Jake Roedel. Where he and his fellow First Kansas Irregulars go, no one is safe, no one can be neutral. Roedel grows up fast, experiencing a brutal parody of war without standards or mercy. But as friends fall and families flee, he questions his loyalties and becomes an outsider even to those who have become outlaws.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[R.J. Decker, star tenant of the local trailer park and neophyte private eye is fishing for a killer. Thanks to a sportsman's scam that's anything but sportsmanlike, there's a body floating in Coon Bog, Florida -- and a lot that's rotten in the murky waters of big-stakes, large-mouth bass tournaments. Here Decker will team up with a half-blind, half-mad hermit with an appetite for road kill; dare to kiss his ex-wife while she's in bed with her new husband; and face deadly TV evangelists, dangerously seductive women, and a pistol-toting redneck with a pit bull on his arm. And here his own life becomes part of the stakes. For while the "double whammy" is the lure, first prize is for the most ingenious murder.]]></book_description>
