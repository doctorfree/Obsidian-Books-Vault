    <book_description><![CDATA[Want to know where Chuck Palahniuk's tonsils currently reside? <br />Been looking for a naked mannequin to hide in your kitchen cabinets? <br />Curious about Chuck's debut in an MTV music video? <br />What goes on at the Scum Center? <br />How do you get to the Apocalypse Café?<br /><br />In the closest thing he may ever write to an autobiography, Chuck Palahniuk provides answers to all these questions and more as he takes you through the streets, sewers, and local haunts of Portland, Oregon. <br /><br />According to Katherine Dunn, author of the cult classic <i>Geek Love</i>, Portland is the home of America's " fugitives and refugees." Get to know these folks, the " most cracked of the crackpots, "as Palahniuk calls them, and come along with him on an adventure through the parts of Portland you might not otherwise believe actually exist. No other travel guide will give you this kind of access to " a little history, a little legend, and a lot of friendly, sincere, fascinating people who maybe should've kept their mouths shut."<br /><br />Here are strange personal museums, weird annual events, and ghost stories. Tour the tunnels under downtown Portland. Visit swingers' sex clubs, gay and straight. See Frances Gabe's famous 1940s Self-Cleaning House. Look into strange local customs like the I-Tit-a-Rod Race and the Santa Rampage. Learn how to talk like a local in a quick vocabulary lesson. Get to know, I mean really get to know, the animals at the Portland zoo.<br /><br />Oh, the list goes on and on.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Now in paperback, the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller by one of rock's most provocative figures <em>Scar Tissue</em> is Anthony Kiedis's searingly honest memoir of a life spent in the fast lane. <br /><br />In 1983, four self-described "knuckleheads" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk. Over twenty years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, against all odds, have become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has gone through many incarnations, Anthony Kiedis, the group's lyricist and dynamic lead singer, has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride. Whether he's recollecting the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses, or retracing a journey that has included appearances as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess. <br /><br /><i>Scar Tissue</i> is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption--a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For his eighteenth birthday, Dusty Baker's parents gave him a great present: Two tickets to the Monterey Pop Festival of June 1967, a three-day event featuring more than thirty bands, and use of the family station wagon for the weekend so young Dusty could drive down from Sacramento to the Monterey Bay Area. He was another young person, trying to take it all in, sleeping on the beach with his buddy, having the time of his life soaking up the vibe and every different musical style represented there. Baker's lifelong love of music was set in motion, his wide-ranging, eclectic tastes, everything from country to hip-hop. He also caught the Jimi Hendrix Experience, who put on such a show that to this day Baker calls Hendrix the most exciting performer he's ever seen. He went on to years of friendship with musicians from B.B. King and John Lee Hooker to Elvin Bishop. This account grabs a reader from page one and never lets up.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[“The incomparable and mysterious Sandy Koufax is revealed…. This is an absorbing book, beautifully written.” —<em>Wall Street Journal</em><br /><br />“Leavy has hit it out of the park…A lot more than a biography. It’s a consideration of how we create our heroes, and how this hero’s self perception distinguishes him from nearly every other great athlete in living memory… a remarkably rich portrait.” — <em>Time</em><br /><br />The instant <em>New York Times</em> bestseller about the baseball legend and famously reclusive Dodgers’ pitcher Sandy Koufax, from award-winning former <em>Washington Post</em> sportswriter Jane Leavy. <em>Sandy Koufax</em> reveals, for the first time, what drove the three-time Cy Young award winner to the pinnacle of baseball and then—just as quickly—into self-imposed exile.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Award-winning sports writer Jane Leavy follows her <em>New York Times</em> runaway bestseller <em>Sandy Koufax</em> with the definitive biography of baseball icon Mickey Mantle. The legendary Hall-of-Fame outfielder was a national hero during his record-setting career with the New York Yankees, but public revelations of alcoholism, infidelity, and family strife badly tarnished the ballplayer's reputation in his latter years. In <em>The Last Boy</em>, Leavy plumbs the depths of the complex athlete, using copious first-hand research as well as her own memories, to show why The Mick remains the most beloved and misunderstood Yankee slugger of all time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[You are part of the grand transition that is underway in energy, but you are probably wondering what it all means for you. Human society has committed to getting off fossil fuels because they are warming our planet, and this shift will engage everyone. Why? Because everyone uses energy. Today you have choices in energy that you never had before, and your choices will affect many generations to come. This book will bring you up to speed on your many options in energy, all explained in terms that anyone can understand.<br /><br />Power Shift: From Fossil Energy to Dynamic Solar Power retells human history through the lens of energy, explains the science behind the crisis–in clear, succinct language that anyone can understand—and provides a detailed blueprint for the future, from governmental, commercial, and individual perspectives.<br /><br />Today, we’ve become mired in partisan bickering among politicians and oil, gas, and coal lobbying interests who insist that fossil fuels are necessary for jobs and the US economy. However, this narrow debate has failed to notice that the world has already embarked on a transformation in how we use energy that is so fundamental, it defines a new Solar Epoch, as monumental as the discovery of fire, the development of agriculture, and the exploitation of fossil fuels in previous centuries.<br /><br />The truth is that solar power–getting radically cheaper by the year–is not only a viable solution but, as the author states, “forms a clean energy system that can completely replace fossil fuels. We can gradually phase them in so that in 50 years we’ll be 100% solar-powered. And because solar energy does not run out like fossil fuels, we will never need to go looking for another energy source again.”<br />Unlike other books on global warming and solar energy, Power Shift presents visionary plans for governments, corporations, and individuals concerned about climate change.<br /><br />And the author has “put his money where his mouth is.” Having built a solar home in Santa Cruz County in 1997 and outfitted it with an off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) system, Stayton cites numerous personal examples to inspire others to take similar action.<br /><br />Destined to become a classic in the field, and soon to be adopted as a basic text in college and university environmental studies programs, Power Shift is an indispensable reference for researchers and global leaders, a valuable staff training tool for solar companies, and a compelling, inspirational read for anyone eager to learn the truth about global warming and to participate “from the ground up” in the new Solar Epoch.<br /><br />Reader-friendly with beautiful illustrations and firmly grounded in current science, Power Shift also forges a cautionary tale of what lies ahead if we don’t start acting now: “We seem to be waiting for a sign,” Stayton writes, “a sudden event so catastrophic that it compels us to overcome political differences and take action. However, this disaster does not rush upon us like a hurricane, but instead slowly erodes our foundation, like termites. If we wait until the house collapses, we will have waited too long.”<br /><br />If you buy only one book on the topic of climate change or solar power–for yourself, family, friends, or colleagues–you can depend on Power Shift to serve as a comprehensive, eye-opening, educational resource for years to come.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Throughout history, Western culture has been bedeviled by false prophets, charlatans, and self-appointed messianic figures. Their appetites for destruction and depravity have led to broken lives and worse-mass suicide and even mass murder. Why does this occur again and again?<br /><br />In <em>Rogue Messiahs</em>, Colin Wilson compellingly recounts the stories and outrageous claims, acts, and abuses of 25 self-proclaimed messiahs who have arisen in the last 300 years. He uncovers the probable factors that turn earnest religious leaders, mystics, or well-intentioned cult leaders into violent, abusive, murderous, and paranoid <em>rogue</em> messiahs.<br /><br />This gallery of spiritual fakers includes many familiar names and faces: David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians; Shoko Asahara, founder of the Aum Supreme Truth cult; Rev. Jim Jones; founder of the infamous Jonestown; Jeffrey Don Lundgren, Mormon con man and murderer; Ervil LeBaron and family, deranged cultist, prophets, and murderers; Rock Theriault, late twentieth-century French Canadian self-proclaimed messiah. Further, Wilson includes a study of others who achieved spiritual insight instead of destruction, and demonstrates that mayhem and benevolence are often two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />These would-be messiahs, in Wilson's analysis, are all driven by a childish dream of absolute power. Almost always, they cross the line from inspiration to paranoia, and from the teaching to killing-genuine aspiration mixed with self-deception, says Wilson. This is an incisive review of the motives and madness of cult leaders, spiritual con men, and would-be saviors.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>In <i>Parting the Waters</i>, the first volume of his essential America in the King Years series, Pulitzer Prize winner Taylor Branch gives a “compelling…masterfully told” (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>) account of Martin Luther King’s early years and rise to greatness.</b><br /><br />Hailed as the most masterful story ever told of the American Civil Rights Movement, <i>Parting the Waters</i> is destined to endure for generations.<br /> <br />Moving from the fiery political baptism of Martin Luther King, Jr., to the corridors of Camelot where the Kennedy brothers weighed demands for justice against the deceptions of J. Edgar Hoover, here is a vivid tapestry of America, torn and finally transformed by a revolutionary struggle unequaled since the Civil War.<br /> <br />Taylor Branch provides an unsurpassed portrait of King's rise to greatness and illuminates the stunning courage and private conflict, the deals, maneuvers, betrayals, and rivalries that determined history behind closed doors, at boycotts and sit-ins, on bloody freedom rides, and through siege and murder.<br /> <br />Epic in scope and impact, Branch's chronicle definitively captures one of the nation's most crucial passages.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Philip K. Dick said that his purpose as a writer was "to pierce through the veil of what is only apparently real and get to what is really real." Meditation upon the nature of reality leads one down strange pathways. Nothing is as it seems. This is a book about a man who experienced this, expressed it brilliantly, and refused to stop at that, devoting himself instead in his works to the passionate and often comical search for what is, if it isn't what it seems to be.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["If you know what you want, I'll get it for you. If you don't know what you want, I'll do it for you."<br /><br />Few record producers possess the musical facility to back up such a bold promise, but in over forty-plus years behind the glass, Todd Rundgren has willed himself into becoming a not only a rock guitar virtuoso, an accomplished lead vocalist and vocal arranger and visionary keyboard player, not to mention a serviceable drummer. But arguably, Rundgren's greatest instrument of all is the recording studio itself. After learning his craft with Nazz, Rundgren engineered The Band's Stage Fright album and soon became the producer of a string of noteworthy albums for Sparks, Grand Funk, The New York Dolls, Badfinger, Hall &amp; Oates, Meat Loaf, Patti Smith Group, Cheap Trick, The Psychedelic Furs and XTC. Meanwhile, Rundgren played almost every instrument on his solo albums such as Something/Anything?, A Wizard A True Star and Hermit Of Mink Hollow while collaborating on a series of albums by his band, Utopia. <i>A Wizard A True Star: Todd Rundgren In The Studio</i> by Paul Myers is a fascinating and authoritative trip through the land of flickering red lights inhabited by a studio wizard - and true star - who has rarely enjoyed a proper victory lap along the many trails that he has blazed. Researched and written with the participation and cooperation of Rundgren himself.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Sometimes a writer has to revisit the classics, and here we find that "gonzo journalism"—gutsy first-person accounts wherein the author is part of the story—didn't originate with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5237.Hunter_S__Thompson" title="Hunter S. Thompson" rel="nofollow noopener">Hunter S. Thompson</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3083854.Tom_Wolfe" title="Tom Wolfe" rel="nofollow noopener">Tom Wolfe</a>. Aldous Huxley took some mescaline &amp; wrote about it some 10 or 12 years earlier than those others. The book he came up with is part bemused essay &amp; part mystical treatise—"suchness" is everywhere to be found while under the influence. This is a good example of essay writing, journal keeping &amp; the value of controversy—always—in one's work.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Anne Dick's book is part memoir, and part a kind of detective novel, as she sifts through the details of her life with Philip K Dick, a prolific genius whose books and novels are being recognized as significant works of literature. Much of Dick's work, currently being celebrated in college courses and prestigious anthologies like The Library of America, consists of a kind of surreal autobiography and Anne's memoir helps us connect his fictional characters to his life. Philip K Dick was quite a character himself, both on and off the page, and Anne's memoir bravely explores her tumultuous relationship with this mercurial man in an attempt to better understand him and his writing. A touching aspect of this memoir is that it represents Anne's search as well.<br /><br />Anne witnessed first-hand the most prolific period in Dick's career, a five year period year stretch from 1958 - 1964 during which time Philip wrote many of his most celebrated novels including: <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</i>, <i>Martian Time-Slip</i>, <i>Confessions of a Crap Artist</i>, <i>Dr Bloodmoney</i>, <i>We Can Build You</i>, <i>Now Wait For Last Year</i>, and <i>The Simulacra</i>. Anne, a fifty four year resident of Point Reyes Station, still lives in the modern Campbell and Wong house she shared with Philip, a house that was featured in many of Dick's books. Reading Anne's memoir will open up many of Philip's works, revealing the autobiographical material often buried deep in his texts. Biography lovers will enjoy the intensity of detail Anne brings to Dick's complex and intense struggles. Anne spent several years conducting interviews with Dick's friends, family, and colleagues, assembling perhaps the most thoroughly researched biography of Philip K Dick currently available. <br /><br />--- <br />Editor's description:<br /><br />Brilliant, talented, and charismatic, Philip K. Dick had it all. Already a successful young writer with a highly promising career, in 1958 he met his intellectual and romantic soulmate, his soon-to-be third wife Anne Rubenstein.<br /><br />To his new family and friends, Dick appeared cheerful and loving. But behind the facade of an untroubled life was a man struggling with inner demons. Slowly and always in denial, Anne watched his disconnect from reality and witnessed his increasing paranoia. Philip K. Dick had begun his descent into madness.<br /><br />In this riveting memoir and biography, Anne Dick creates an extraordinary portrait of one of the twentieth century's most important writers. Through this no-holds-barred account, she reveals the compelling genius and private hell of Philip K. Dick, for better and for worse.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Maybe this book is TMI but for a Phil Dick fanatic like myself it is juicy behind the scenes real life meets sci-fi meets am I insane or are those really CIA/FBI/Aliens following me. Dick's 3rd wife Anne tells every bit of her side of the story in this frank account of their years together in Point Reyes. She follows this up with a thoroughly researched accounting of PKD's descent into  after he left her and moved to the East Bay and later Southern California. The book likely enraged Dick fans around the world but it's a fascinating read. Not only because Philip K. Dick is one of the most fascinating people to have lived but also because Anne Dick manages to remind us what life was like for an American wife and woman in the Fifties and Sixties. Everything, including most people's neurotic behavior, was blamed on the mother. Heck, at one point the Point Reyes sheriff comes out to their house, talks calmly with Phil Dick, and trundles Anne off to a mental hospital for 72 hours observation! Those were the days. ]]></user_review>

It’s Me Chelsea and Artie Lange’s Too Fat to Fish, you’ll love The Bedwetter.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>In the tradition of <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, </i>a stunningly vivid historical account of the forty-year battle between Comanche Indians and white settlers for control of the American West, centering on Quanah, the greatest Comanche chief of them all.</p><p>S. C. Gwynne’s <i>Empire of the Summer Moon</i><b> </b>spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. </p><p>Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled <i>backward </i>by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun. </p><p>The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne’s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads—a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being. </p><p>Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker, a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes who was kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the "White Squaw" who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. More famous still was her son Quanah, a warrior who was never defeated and whose guerrilla wars in the Texas Panhandle made him a legend. </p><p></p><p>S. C. Gwynne’s account of these events is meticulously researched, intellectually provocative, and, above all, thrillingly told.</p>]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[This extensively researched history of the Comanche should be required reading for every American. Gwynne manages to transform what could be an exhaustively detailed dry account into a gripping tale of historical scale. Not for the squeamish, Gwynne pulls no punches in his account - a major plus as far as I am concerned as the truth in this chapter should not be edited. The book contains tons of fascinating fact. For instance, did you know that Buffalo Hump (born ca. late 1790s to early 19th century — died 1870) was a Native American War Chief of the Penateka band of the Comanche Indians. His Nʉmʉ tekwapu (Comanche) name, properly transliterated, was Po-cha-na-quar-hip which meant "erection that won't go down" ? Or, that Isa-tai ("Wolf's Vulva" c.1840 — c.1890) was a Comanche warrior and medicine man of the Quahadi band. Originally named Quenatosavit (White Eagle), after the debacle at Adobe Walls he was known as Isa-tai which translates as "wolf's vulva" or "coyote vagina" ?<br /><br />Gwynne uses the life of Quanah Parker and Quanah's family as his focus to tie the epic saga together and provide a bigger than life character the reader can bond with. The Parker family could have their own book and the story of Quanah Parker is uniquely apropos as a microcosm of the larger story of the Native American tribes. If I could recommend only one book and it couldn't be any Brautigan or Vonnegut or Dick or Steinbeck or Robbins or McMurtry plus it had to be non-fiction then this would be it! :)]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>IBM &amp; the Holocaust</b> tells of IBM's strategic alliance with Nazi Germany--beginning in 1933 in the 1st weeks that Hitler came to power &amp; continuing well into WWII. As the 3rd Reich embarked upon its plan of conquest &amp; genocide, IBM &amp; its subsidiaries helped create enabling technologies, step-by-step, from the identification &amp; cataloging programs of the 30s to the selections of the 40s. Only after Jews were identified--a massively complex task Hitler wanted done immediately--could they be targeted for efficient asset confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, enslaved labor &amp; annihilation. It was a cross-tabulation &amp; organizational challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 30s no computer existed. But IBM's Hollerith punch card technology did exist. Aided by the company's custom-designed &amp; constantly updated Hollerith systems, Hitler was able to automate the persecution of the Jews.<br /><br />Historians were amazed at the speed &amp; accuracy with which the Nazis were able to identify &amp; locate European Jewry. Until now, the pieces of this puzzle have never been fully assembled. The fact is, IBM technology was used to organize nearly everything in Germany &amp; then Nazi Europe, from the identification of the Jews in censuses, registrations &amp; ancestral tracing programs to the running of railroads &amp; organizing of concentration camp slave labor. IBM &amp; its German subsidiary custom-designed complex solutions, anticipating the Reich's needs. They didn't merely sell the machines &amp; walk away. Instead, IBM leased these machines for high fees &amp; became the sole source of the billions of punch cards needed. <b>IBM &amp; the Holocaust</b> details the carefully crafted corporate collusion with the 3rd Reich, as well as the structured deniability of oral agreements, undated letters &amp; the Geneva intermediaries--all undertaken as the newspapers blazed with accounts of persecution &amp; destruction. Just as compelling is the human drama of one of our century's greatest minds, IBM founder Thomas Watson, who cooperated with the Nazis for the sake of profit. Only with IBM's technologic assistance was Hitler able to achieve the staggering numbers of the Holocaust. Edwin Black has now uncovered one of the last great mysteries of Germany's war against the Jews: how Hitler got the names.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The dust storms that terrorized the High Plains in the darkest years of the Depression were like nothing ever seen before or since. Timothy Egan’s critically acclaimed account rescues this iconic chapter of American history from the shadows in a tour de force of historical reportage. Following a dozen families and their communities through the rise and fall of the region, Egan tells of their desperate attempts to carry on through blinding black dust blizzards, crop failure, and the death of loved ones. Brilliantly capturing the terrifying drama of catastrophe, Egan does equal justice to the human characters who become his heroes, “the stoic, long-suffering men and women whose lives he opens up with urgency and respect” (New York Times).<br /><br />In an era that promises ever-greater natural disasters, The Worst Hard Time is “arguably the best nonfiction book yet” (Austin Statesman Journal) on the greatest environmental disaster ever to be visited upon our land and a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of trifling with nature.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Few books have caused as big a stir as John Steinbeck’s <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, when it was published in April 1939. By May, it was the nation’s number one bestseller, but in Kern County, California—the Joads’ newfound home—the book was burned publicly and banned from library shelves. <i>Obscene in the Extreme</i> tells the remarkable story behind this fit of censorship.When W. B. “Bill” Camp, a giant cotton and potato grower, presided over its burning in downtown Bakersfield, he declared: “We are angry, not because we were attacked but because we were attacked by a book obscene in the extreme sense of the word.” But Gretchen Knief, the Kern County librarian, bravely fought back. “If that book is banned today, what book will be banned tomorrow?”<br /><br /><i>Obscene in the Extreme</i> serves as a window into an extraordinary time of upheaval in America—a time when, as Steinbeck put it, there seemed to be “a revolution . . . going on.”]]></book_description>
