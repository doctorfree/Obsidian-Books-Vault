    <book_description><![CDATA[McMurtry brings readers up to date on one of his most beloved novels, Terms of Endearment, and on one of his most memorable characters, Aurora Greenway, along with her family, friends, and lovers, in this richly imagined and satisfying tale. At once loving and comic, but always bittersweet with the unexpected turns and failures of life, this is McMurtry at his best.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Blood Meridian</i> is an epic novel of the violence and depravity that attended America's westward expansion, brilliantly subverting the conventions of the Western novel and the mythology of the Wild West. Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennesseean who stumbles into a nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this slim volume of essays, novelist/screenwriter McMurtry offers his refreshing views on movies, both junk (yea) and art (nay), Hollywood and its populace, the process of filmmaking, the power of money, film audiences, and critics. His experiences and thoughts on screenwriting, adapting novels, adapting one's own novels (a bad idea), and on the craft itself contain more useful information than a pile of how-to manuals. <br /><br />As in his novels, McMurtry is by turns witty, acerbic, and thoughtful; the pieces are surprisingly stylish in that the bulk of them (17 out of 21) were spun off on monthly deadlines (for American Film magazine, in 1975-77), and McMurtry admittedly can't remember writing most of them. A fine collection, from a fine writer.<br /><br />No Clue: Or Learning to Write for the Movies. --<br />The Hired Pen. --<br />The Deadline Syndrome. --<br />The Telephone Booth Screenwriter. --<br />The Fun of It All. --<br />All the President's Men, Seven Beauties, History, Innocence, Guilt, Redemption, and the Star System. --<br />The Screenplay as Non-Book: A Consideration. --<br />Pencils West: Or a Theory for the Shoot-'Em Up. --<br />"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and the Movie-Less Novelists. --<br />O Ragged Time Knit Up Thy Ravell'd Sleave. --<br />The Situation in Criticism: Reviewers, Critics, Professors. --<br />Character, the Tube, and the Death of Movies. --<br />The Disappearance of Love. --<br />Woody Allen, Keith Carradine, Lily Tomlin, and the Disappearance of Grace. --<br />The Last Picture Shows. --<br />The Seasons of L.A.. --<br />The Last Movie Column. --<br />The Last Picture Show: A Last Word. --<br />Approaching Cheyenne ...

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Pulitzer Prize–winning Larry McMurtry writes like no one else about the American frontier—though in <i>Somebody's Darling,</i> the frontier lies farther west, in Hollywood, and his subject is the strange world of the movies—those who make them and those who play in them.</b><br /><br /><i>Somebody's Darling</i> is the story of the fortunes of Jill Peel. Jill is brilliant, talented, and disciplined, and one of the best female directors in Hollywood, or anywhere else. She's got it all together, except where the men in her life are concerned: Joe Percy and Owen Oarson. Joe is a womanizing, aging screenwriter, cheerfully cynical about life, love, and art, and the pursuit of all three. But he'd rather be left alone with the young, oversexed wives of studio moguls. Owen is an ex-Texas football player and tractor salesman turned studio climber and sexual athlete. He'll climb from bed to bed in pursuit of his starry goal: to be a movie producer. Between the two of them and a cast of Hollywood's most unforgettable eccentrics, Jill Peel tries to create some movie magic.<br /> <br />Full of all the grit and warmth of his best work, <i>Somebody's Darling</i> is Larry McMurtry's deft and raunchy romp behind the scenes of America's own unique Babel: Hollywood.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Pulitzer Prize–winner Larry McMurtry writes novels set in the American heartland, but his real territory is the heart itself. His gift for writing about women—their love for reckless, hopeless men; their ability to see the good in losers; and their peculiar combination of emotional strength and sudden weakness—makes <i>The Desert Rose</i> the bittersweet, funny, and touching book that it is.</b><br /><br />Harmony is a Las Vegas showgirl with the best legs in town. At night she's a lead dancer in a gambling casino; during the day she raises peacocks. She throws her love away on second-rate men, but wakes up in the morning full of hope. She's one of a dying breed of dancers, faced with fewer and fewer jobs and an even bleaker future. Yet, she maintains a calm cheerfulness in that arid neon landscape of supermarkets, drive-in wedding chapels, and all-night casinos.<br /> <br />While Harmony's star is fading, her beautiful, cynical daughter Pepper's is on the rise. But Harmony remains wistful and optimistic through it all. She is the unexpected blossom in the wasteland, the tough and tender desert rose. Hers is a loving portrait that only Larry McMurtry could render.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>In <i>Cadillac Jack,</i> Larry McMurtry—Pulitzer Prize–winning author of <i>Lonesome </i><i>Dove</i>—proves his unique talent for conjuring up the real, often eccentric people who inhabit the American heartland and for capturing the peculiarly American search for new frontiers and adventure.</b><br /><br /><i>Cadillac Jack</i> is a rodeo-cowboy-turned-antique-scout whose nomadic, womanizing life—centered on his classic pearl-colored Cadillac—rambles between the Texas flatlands of flea markets and small-time auctions and Washington, D.C.'s political-social life of parties, hustlers, vixens, and spies. Along the way he meets a cast of indelibly etched characters: among them, the strikingly beautiful, social-climbing Cindy Sanders; Boog Miller, the tackily-dressing millionaire good ol' boy who patronizes Jack's business and who has more political muscle than a litter of lobbyists; Khaki Descartes, the pushy, brain-picking, Washington woman reporter; Freddy Fu, an undercover CIA agent working out of a greasy barbecue joint called The Cover-Up; and Jean Arber, the mother of two and a fledgling antique-store owner who can't quite figure out if she'll marry Jack or not.<br /> <br />Wild, touching, and hilariously funny, <i>Cadillac Jack</i> is Larry McMurtry's raucous social satire of sex, politics, and love in the fast lane, peopled with Americans only he could render.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[With a riotously colorful cast of highbrows, cowpokes, and rodeo queens, in its wry humor, tenderness, and epic panorama, <i>Moving On</i> is a celebration of our land by Larry McMurtry, one of America’s best-loved authors.<br /><br /><i>Moving On </i>is a big, powerful novel about men and women in the American West. Set in the 1960s against the backdrop of the honky-tonk glamour of the rodeo and the desperation of suburban Houston, it is the story of the restless and lovable Patsy Carpenter, one of Larry McMurtry’s most unforgettable characters.<br /><br />Patsy—young, beautiful, with a sharp tongue and an irresistible charm—and her shiftless husband, Jim, are adrift in the West. Patsy moves through affairs of the heart like small towns—there’s Pete, the rodeo clown, and Hank, the graduate student, and others—always in search of the life that seems ever receding around the next bend. <i>Moving On</i> is vintage McMurtry.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of <i>Lonesome Dove</i> Larry McMurtry comes the second novel about love and loss on the great plains of Texas. From 1920’s ranching to range cowboys and WWII grief, McMurtry is the undisputed father of the Western literary epic.<br /><br /><i>Leaving Cheyenne</i> traces the loves of three West Texas characters as they follow that sundown trail: Gideon Fry, the serious rancher; Johnny McCloud, the free-spirited cowhand; and Molly Taylor, the sensitive woman they both love and who bears them each a son. Told in alternating perspectives over sixty years, <i>Leaving Cheyenne</i> follows their dreams, secrets, and grief against a changing American landscape. <br /><br />Tragic circumstances mark the trail, but fans of McMurtry’s distinctive style will cherish his unforgettable characters and pathos of the American West.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Funny, sad, full of wonderful characters and the word-perfect dialogue of which he is the master, McMurtry brings the Thalia saga to an end with Duane confronting depression in the midst of plenty.</b><br /><br />Surrounded by his children, who all seem to be going through life crises involving sex, drugs, and violence; his wife, Karla, who is wrestling with her own demons; and friends like Sonny, who seem to be dying, Duane can't seem to make sense of his life anymore. He gradually makes his way through a protracted end-of-life crisis of which he is finally cured by reading Proust's <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, a combination of penance, and prescription from Dr. Carmichael that somehow works.<br /> <br /><i>Duane's Depressed</i> is the work of a powerful, mature artist, with a deep understanding of the human condition, a profound ability to write about small-town life, and perhaps the surest touch of any American novelist for the tangled feelings that bind and separate men and women.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of <i>Lonesome</i> <i>Dove</i> comes the novel that became the basis for the film <i>Hud</i>, starring Paul Newman. In classic Western style Larry McMurtry illustrates the timeless conflict between the modernity and the Old West through the eyes of Texas cattlemen.<br /><br /><i>Horseman, Pass By</i> tells the story of Homer Bannon, an old-time cattleman who epitomizes the frontier values of honesty and decency, and Hud, his unscrupulous stepson. Caught in the middle is the narrator, Homer's young grandson Lonnie, who is as much drawn to his grandfather’s strength of character as he is to Hud's hedonism and materialism. <br /><br />When first published in 1961, <i>Horseman, Pass By</i> caused a sensation in Texas literary circles for its stark, realistic portrayal of the struggles of a changing West in the years following World War II. Never before had a writer managed to encapsulate its environment with such unsentimental realism. Today, memorable characters, powerful themes, and illuminating detail make <i>Horseman, Pass By</i> vintage McMurtry.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Ranging from Texas to California on a young writer's journey in a car he calls El Chevy, <i>All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers </i>is one of Larry McMurtry's most vital and entertaining novels. <br /> Danny Deck is on the verge of success as an author when he flees Houston and hurtles unexpectedly into the hearts of three women: a girlfriend who makes him happy but who won't stay, a neighbor as generous as she is lusty, and his pal Emma Horton. It's a wild ride toward literary fame and an uncharted country...beyond everyone he deeply loves. <i>All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers</i> is a wonderful display of Larry McMurtry's unique gift: his ability to re-create the subtle textures of feelings, the claims of passing time and familiar place, and the rich interlocking swirl of people's lives.]]></book_description>
