review: Stephenson's writing improves dramatically in this, his 2nd novel. It's remarkable the degree of improvement in writing from "The Big U" to "Zodiac". Well done!<br/><br/>If you are looking for an eco-thriller then I can highly recommend this at times hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable educational read.
