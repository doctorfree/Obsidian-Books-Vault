review: I really loved this novel. Sort of a hybrid between a hard-bitten detective novel by Raymond Chandler and a surreal fantasy world of Richard Brautigan. I wonder if Murakami was influenced by Brautigan who, later in his career, became famous in Japan and even moved there for a while.<br/><br/>This book was such a pleasure to read. I'm sad I've finished it. However, I have plenty more of Murakami to read.
