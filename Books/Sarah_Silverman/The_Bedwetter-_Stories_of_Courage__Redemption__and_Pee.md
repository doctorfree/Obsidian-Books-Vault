review: As you would expect - hilarious! But, what I did not expect, it's a self help book! And, I don't mean bed wetting - although I would imagine someone with that problem would get a lot of help out of reading this book. I mean, Silverman imparts life lessons in here. Really great stuff plus it is such a fun read.
