review: Man. Another new author (to me). This guy reminds me of Cormac McCarthy or Faulkner (if Faulkner was an easier read). But, he's got a similar feel for a very harsh micro-subculture - for Woodrell it's the Ozarks along the Missouri/Arkansas border. I've been there and he's not far from the mark although I didn't rub shoulders with the crank culture. This novel manages to be sweet, harsh, despairing, and gritty. Maybe not everybody's cup of tea but I loved it.
