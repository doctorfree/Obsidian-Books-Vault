## Review

A different kind of novel. Short stories, perhaps, but still a novel. Poignant. I was totally immersed, inside the characters. It's unusual for an experimental work to be so accessible.<br/><br/>Time is a stealth goon so read this one slowly appreciating every chapter's poignant portrait.
