review: Is Flannery O'Connor the greatest short story writer of our time ? Perhaps. Anyway, I love her. What a great read this collection is, including her letters. How does she manage to be so dark and so funn ? Love her stories about her peacocks. I wonder what the Mark Twain re-writers will do when they discover O'Connor's use of the N-word ?
