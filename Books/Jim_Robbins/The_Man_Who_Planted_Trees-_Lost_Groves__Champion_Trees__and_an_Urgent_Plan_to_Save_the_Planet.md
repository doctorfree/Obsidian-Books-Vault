review: The story of David Milarch is fascinating and a good read. Robbins is easy to read, informative, and presents the science well. I learned a lot - the book is inspiring and informative. However, he could have left out the mystical mumbo jumbo which tends to undermine the credibility of the author and actors in this extremely important narrative. Still, just ignore those passages, there is plenty of hard science in here to support the program.
