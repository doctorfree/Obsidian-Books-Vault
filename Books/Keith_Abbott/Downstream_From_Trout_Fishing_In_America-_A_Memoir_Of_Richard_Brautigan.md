review: By far the best book on Brautigan I have read. Most reviewers just never "got" Brautigan and the subsequent works on his life and writing reflected those misconceptions, misunderstandings, and plain mistruths. Keith Abbott not only paints a loving portrait of the author, poet, and friend but provides us with what is perhaps the best literary analysis and review of Brautigan's writing.<br/><br/>I whole heartedly recommend this book not only for the Brautigan fanatic but I think it would make a great introduction to the reader just embarking on a study of Brautigan.
