review: A new author (to me)! Love this guy - I'll read every book he's written. Sick Puppy has so many places and people that remind me of my years in Florida. Hilarious and eco-socio-economically incisive at the same time. I recommend Hiaasen.

## Review

A new author (to me)! Love this guy - I'll read every book he's written. Sick Puppy has so many places and people that remind me of my years in Florida. Hilarious and eco-socio-economically incisive at the same time. I recommend Hiaasen.
